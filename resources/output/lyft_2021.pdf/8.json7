We  designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Our proprietary technology efficiently matchesriders\n with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. Additional modes, such asLight\n Vehicles,  offer  riders  more  options  for  shorter  trips.  The  more  rides  that  are  taken  on  our  platform,  the  better  we  are  able  to  offer  riders  personalizedexperiences most suitab\nle to the trip being planned.\u2022\nAvailability. We  strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and ridersconnect efficient\nly and reduce wait times.\u2022\nAffordability. Our platform empowers ride rs to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time.\u2022\nSafety. Since day one, we have worked continuousl y to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policiesand processes.\nBusiness\nLyft\n is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people\u2019s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education andgovernment.\n Our  comprehensive  set  of  solutions  allows  clients  to  design,  manage  and  pay  for  ground  transportation  programs  that  contribute  to  productivity  andsatisfaction while redu\ncing cost, improving transparency and streamlining operations.Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations\nWe\n organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focuson\n affordability,  reliability,  efficiency,  optimization  and  cohesion  when  developing  our  software.  Our  offerings  are  mobile-first  and  platform  agnostic.  We  seek  tocontinuously improve the Lyft Pl\natform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.We have a commercial agreement with Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) for cloud services to help deliver and ho\nst our platform. As a result of our partnership, webelieve\n we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect untilterminated\n by  AWS  or  us.  AWS  may  only  terminate  the  agreement  for  convenience  after  January  31,  2026,  and  only  after  complying  with  certain  advance  noticerequirements.\n AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providingprior\n written notice and a 30-day cure period. Under this agreement, we committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June 2022 onAWS\n services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. In February 2022, we amended the agreement and committed to spend an aggregate of atleast\n $350  million  between  February  2022  and  January  2026,  with  a  minimum  of  $80  million  in  each  of  the  four  years.  If  we  fail  to  meet  the  minimum  purchasecommitment\n during any year, we may be required to pay the difference. We pay AWS monthly, and we may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to AWSbased on usage.\nWe\n designed  our  platform  with  multiple  layers  of  redundancy  to  guard  against  data  loss  and  deliver  high  availability.  Both  incremental  and  full  backups  areperformed\n and redundant copies of content are stored independently in separate geographic regions. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our dataprivacy and security founda\ntion, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform\nOur robust technology platform powers the millions of\n rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time.We\n leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle,from when drivers go online and r\niders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilitiesto\n predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance  supply and demand in the marketplace,  creatingincreased driver ea\nrnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development.Our Intellectual Property\nWe\n believe  that  our  intellectual  property  rights  are  valuable  and  important  to  our  business.  We  rely  on  trademarks,  patents,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  licenseagreements,\n intellectual  property assignment  agreements,  confidentiality  procedures,  non-disclosure  agreements  and employee  non-disclosure  and invention assignmentagreements to\n establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills andingenuity of our employees and \nthe functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and offerings are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.8\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
