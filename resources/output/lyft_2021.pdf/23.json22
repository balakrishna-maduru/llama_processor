As we continue to expand intonew\n geographic areas, we will be relying in part on referrals from our existing riders to attract new riders, and therefore we must ensure that our existing riders remainsatisfied\n with our offerings. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience seasonality in both ridesharing and Light Vehicle rentals during the wintermonths,\n which may harm our ability to attract and retain riders during such periods. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased and may continue to affect utilizationof\n our platform by riders, including longer term. If we fail to continue to grow our rider base, retain existing riders or increase the overall utilization of our platform byexisting\n riders, we may not be able to provide drivers with an adequate level of ride requests, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could beadversely\n affected. In addition, if we do not achieve sufficient utilization of our asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Rentals vehicles,our business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely substantially on our wholly-owned subsidiary and deductibles to insure auto-related risks and on third-party insurance policies to insure and reinsure ouroperations-related\n risks. If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet theirobligations, we may not be able to mit\nigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.From the\n time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through ourwholly-owned\n insurance  subsidiary  and  deductibles,  often  bear  substantial  financial  risk  with  respect  to  auto-related  incidents,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  andunderinsured\n motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certainlimits.\n To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurancepolicies\n which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related r\nisk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with athird-party\n financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as ofDecember\n 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory requirements or otherregulations\n governing  insurance  coverage,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  any  of  our  third-party  insuranceproviders\n or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they could be unable to pay any operations-relatedclaims that we make.\nWe\n also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers\u2019 compensation, businessinterruptions,\n cybersecurity  and  data  breaches,  crime,  directors\u2019  and  officers\u2019  liability  and  general  business  liabilities,  including  product  liability.  For  certain  types  ofoperations-related\n risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be able to, or may choosenot\n to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolvingofferings, and\n we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsuranceproviders\n becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, butnot limited to losses caus\ned by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.The\n amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits,for\n which we have borne and could continue to bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwisepaid\n by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of claims, coverages and for a variety of commercial risks andare\n likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when ourpolicies\n are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim,premiums\n or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providersfail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not pr\novided, (v) the number of claims and average claim cost under our deductibles orself-insured retent\nions differs from historic averages or (vi) an insurance policy is cancelled or non-renewed.Our actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adv\nersely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n establish  insurance  reserves  for  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  paid  and  claims  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  related  estimable  expenses,  and  weperiodically\n evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employvarious\n predictive  modeling  and  actuarial  techniques  and  make  numerous  assumptions  based  on  limited  historical  experience  and  industry  statistics  to  estimate  ourinsurance\n reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative.While\n an independent actuary firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can affect theactual\n losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatorydevelopments, judicial d\nevelopments and unexpected23\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
