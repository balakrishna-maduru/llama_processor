The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax asse\nts such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company\u2019s history of net losses since its inception.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federa\nl and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.The\n federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through2037,\n while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue\n to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change lim\nitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The\n Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state incom\ne tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The\n Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earning\ns outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to \nthe participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The\n Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand\n penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated\n statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.
