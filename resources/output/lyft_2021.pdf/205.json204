For purposes of this MutualArbitration\n Agreement (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related toLyft,\n Inc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents,and\n all successors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after theAgreement\n terminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individualbasis;\n class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and Iagree that the arbitrator's award will be final and binding on both parties.\nThis\n Arbitration  Agreement  is  intended  to  be  broadly  interpreted.  The  types  of  disputes  and  claims  covered  by  this  Arbitration  Agreement(referred\n to  below  as  \u201cClaims\u201d)  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  disputes  over  rights  provided  by  federal,  state,  or  local  statutes,  regulations,ordinances,\n and common law; claims related to salary, overtime, bonuses, vacation, paid time off, wages, meal and rest breaks, and any otherform\n of  compensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional  distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  theimplied\n covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination and unlawful harassment based on anyprotected\n classification,  including  claims  under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  AgeDiscrimination\n in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and any state employment statutes, such as the California FairEmployment & Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.\n2.\nDisputes Excluded From Arbitration This\n Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers\u2019  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment benefits.\n Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission,\nU.S.\n Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  CompliancePrograms,\n the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating inany\n administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in courtto avoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.\n3.\nClass Action/Collective Action Waiver Lyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neither\nI\n nor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all partiesagree\n in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither  I nor Lyft mayseek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other employees.\nNotwithstanding\n any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this sectionmay\n be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit theenforcement\n of any of this section\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from thearbitration and may be brought in court.\n4.\nRepresentative PAGA Waiver To the fullest extent permitted by law, Lyft and I (1) \nagree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (\u201cPAGA\u201d)\n, California Labor Code \u00a7 2698 et seq ., in ", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
