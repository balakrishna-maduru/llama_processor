A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed or other functionality of our offeringscould adversely affec\nt our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in harm orlosses to the users using our plat\nform, we may make voluntary payments to compensate for such harm or the affected users could seek monetary recourse or contractualremedies from us for th\neir losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.Our platform contains t\nhird-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrictour ability to provide our offerings.\nOur\n platform  and offerings  contain  software modules  licensed  to us by third-party  authors  under \u201copen source\u201d  licenses.  Use and distribution  of open sourcesoftware\n may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification orother\n contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others tocompromise our platfor\nm and offerings.Some\n open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of opensource software we use, or grant o\nther licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,under\n certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similarofferings\n with lower  development  effort  and time  and  ultimately  could result  in a  loss of our competitive  advantages.  Alternatively,  to avoid the public  release  of theaffected portions of our sou\nrce code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.Although we\n have processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many opensource\n licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipatedconditions\n or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of opensource\n software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership ofwhat\n we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will beeffective. If we are held to\n have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or otherliability, or be required t\no seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our offerings on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform,to discontinue or delay\n the provision of our offerings if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, ourproprietary code, any of which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n presence  outside  the  United  States  and  any  future  international  expansion  strategy  will  subject  us  to  additional  costs  and  risks  and  our  plans  may  not  besuccessful.\nIn\n 2017, we launched our offerings in Canada and we may continue to expand our international offerings. In addition, we have several international offices thatsupport\n our business. We also transact internationally to source and manufacture bikes and scooters and may increase our business in international regions in the future.Operating\n outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms andcustoms,\n in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and maynot be successful in our inte\nrnational expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\u2022\ncompetition  from  local  incumbents  that  better  understand  the  local  market,  may  market  and  operate  more  effectively  and  may  enjoy  greater  local  affinity  orawareness;\n\u2022\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\u2022\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\u2022\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, tax, trade compliance and local regulatoryrestrictions and disclosu\nre requirements;\u2022\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries or theft or unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and otherconfidential business info\nrmation;\u2022\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses or other authorizations;\u2022\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;39\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
