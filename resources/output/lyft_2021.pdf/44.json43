For example, inconnection with the\n sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division to Woven Planet, we have entered into certain data sharing and other agreements with Woven Planet tofacilitate\n and accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology. Changes in the law or regulatory landscape could limit or prohibit activities in this regard.Further,\n the  collection  and  storage  of  data  in  connection  with  the  use  of  our  Concierge  and  Lyft  Pass  for  Healthcare  offerings  by  healthcare  partners  subjects  us  tocompliance\n requirements under HIPAA. HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure ofindividuals\u2019\n protected health information, or PHI. In 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security requirementsdirectly\n upon  business  associates  of  covered  entities.  Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  ourConcierge\n or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclosethe\n PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breachnotification obligations,\n and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a \u201cbreach.\u201d If we knowingly breach theHITECH\n Act\u2019s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from $100 -$50,000 per violation, with an annual \nmaximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for \u201cwillful neglect\u201d violations and the possibility of civil litigation.Additionally,\n we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information securitystandards\n and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRAimposing\n new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, wemay\n face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effortto\n do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them. Aswe\n consider expansion of business offerings and markets and as laws and regulations change, we expect to incur additional costs related to privacy, data protection andinformation\n security standards and protocols imposed by laws, regulations, industry standards or contractual obligations related to such offerings and face additional risksthat such expansion could be incons\nistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of such laws, regulations or obligations.Despite our efforts to comp\nly with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible thatour\n practices, offerings or platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, orthe failure\n by our third-party providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or informationsecurity,\n or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally identifiable information or other driver or rider data, or theperception\n that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing drivers and riders from usingour\n platform  or  result  in  fines  or  proceedings  by  governmental  agencies  and  private  claims  and  litigation,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and\n results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of concerns relating to privacy, data protection or information security, whether ornot valid, may harm our repu\ntation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are\n regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\nWe\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary courseof\n business,  including  those  involving  personal  injury,  property  damage,  worker  classification,  labor  and  employment,  anti-discrimination,  commercial  disputes,competition,\n consumer complaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, securities laws, and other matters, and we may become subjectto\n additional  types  of  claims,  lawsuits,  government  investigations  and  legal  or  regulatory  proceedings  as  our  business  grows  and  as  we  deploy  new  offerings  such  asautonomous\n vehicle  technology,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  deliveries,  including  proceedings  related  toproduct\n liability  or  our  acquisitions,  securities  issuances  or  business  practices.  We  are  also  regularly  subject  to  claims,  lawsuits,  arbitration  proceedings,  governmentinvestigations\n and other legal and regulatory proceedings seeking to hold us liable for the actions of independent contractor drivers on our platform. See the section titled\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for add\nitional information about these types of legal proceedings.The\n results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted withcertainty.\n Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  time-consuming,  result  in  costly  litigation,  be  harmful  to  our  reputation,  require  significantmanagement\n attention and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex and fact-intensive  process that requires significantsubjective\n judgment  and  speculation.  It  is  possible  that  a  resolution  of  one  or  more  such  proceedings  could  result  in  substantial  damages,  settlement  costs,  fines  andpenalties that could adv\nersely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
