In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to ourbusiness and our ability to serv\nice or repay our indebtedness would increase.We are subject to counterparty risk with respe\nct to the capped call transactions.In\n connection  with  the  issuance  of  our  2025  Notes,  we  entered  into  the  capped  call  transactions,  or  Capped  Calls.  The  option  counterparties  are  financialinstitutions,\n and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties willnot be secured\n by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If anoption\n counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that timeunder\n the Capped Calls with such option counterparty.  Our exposure  will depend on many factors  but, generally,  an increase  in our exposure will be correlated  to anincrease\n in  the  market  price  and  in  the  volatility  of  our  Class  A  common  stock.  In  addition,  upon  a  default  by  an  option  counterparty,  we  may  suffer  adverse  taxconsequences\n and  more  dilution  than  we  currently  anticipate  with  respect  to  our  Class  A  common  stock.  We  can  provide  no  assurance  as  to  the  financial  stability  orviability of the option coun\nterparties.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \ntax attributes may be limited.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had $7.5 billion of federal and $6.7 billion of state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) available to reduce future taxable income, whichwill begin to\n expire in 2030 for federal and 2022 for state purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration, or atall.\n Under Section 382 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation  undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change\n NOLs to offset its post-change  income may be limited.  In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative  change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d \nthat exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use net operating lossesto\n reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in thefuture.\nThe\n Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, among other things, includes changes to the rules governingour\n U.S. Federal NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking theNOLs\n into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five-year carryback andindefinite\n carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. Not allstates conform to the Tax Act or CARE\nS Act and some states have varying conformity to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset isrecognized\n related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuationallowance assessments for NOLs gene\nrated after December 31, 2017.Risks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effe\nct of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the outcomeof important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur\n Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued andoutstanding\n shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Accordingly,  Logan  Green,  our  co-founder,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors  holdsapproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our\n outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holdsapproximately\n 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influencematters\n submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale ofall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our C\no-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may votein\n a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a changein\n control  of  our company,  could  deprive  our  stockholders  of  an opportunity  to  receive  a  premium  for  their  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  sale  of our  company  and  mightultimately\n affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder\u2019s voting power is as of December 31, 2021 and includes shares of Class A commonstock expected to be issued upon th\ne vesting of such Co-Founder\u2019s RSUs within 60 days of December 31, 2021.Future\n transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limitedexceptions,\n such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share ofClass\n A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)the date fixed\n by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common stock held by ourCo-Founders\n and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permittedentities\n as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or becomedisabled of our Co-Founders, or such\n50\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
