Additionally, we maintain otherconfidential,\n proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business, including intellectual property, and similar information we receive from third parties.An\n increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions and governmentinstitutions,\n have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highlytargeted\n attacks. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and may not be known until launchedagainst\n us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks. Unauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems orfacilities\n we maintain or use in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of our service providers,partners\n or users on our platform, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, service providers, partners, users or others into disclosing rider names, passwords,payment card\n information or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems, or attempting to fraudulently induce ouremployees,\n partners or others into manipulating payment information, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to criminal actors. In addition, users on our platformcould\n have  vulnerabilities  on  their  own  devices  that  are  entirely  unrelated  to  our  systems  and  platform,  but  could  mistakenly  attribute  their  own  vulnerabilities  to  us.Further,\n breaches  or  incidents  experienced  by  other  companies  may  also  be  leveraged  against  us.  For  example,  credential  stuffing  attacks  are  becoming  increasinglycommon and\n sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported bysignificant financial and tech\nnological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.Although we\n have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our users\u2019 data, prevent data loss and prevent other security breaches or incidents,these\n security measures cannot guarantee total security or prevent incidents from impacting our platform. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerableto cyberattacks or\n security breaches or incidents, including ransomware or other malware that may result in interruptions to our operations or unavailability of our platform,and\n third parties may be able to access our users\u2019 personal information and payment card data that are accessible through those systems. Additionally, as we expand ouroperations,\n including licensing or sharing data with third parties, having employees or third-party relationships in jurisdictions outside the United States, or expand work-from-home\n practices  of our  employees  (including  increased  use of  video  conferencing),  our  exposure  to cyberattacks  or  security  breaches  and incidents  may  increase.Further,\n employee and service provider error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceivedprivacy\n or security breach or other security incident. Although we have policies restricting access to personal information we store, in the past there have been allegationsregarding violations\n of these policies and we may be subject to these types of allegations in the future. Our third-party service providers also face similar security risks. Weand\n our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyberattacks or other sources ofsecurity\n breaches or incidents, and we or they may face difficulties or delays in identifying and responding to cyberattacks and data security breaches and incidents. Inparticular,\n our service providers may also be the targets of cyberattacks, malicious software, phishing schemes, and other attacks, and our third-party service providers\u2019systems and networks may be, or may have been, breached or\n contain exploitable vulnerabilities or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our or their systemsor networks.\nAny actual or perceived privacy or security breach or incident could interrupt our operations\n, result in our platform being unavailable or otherwise disrupted, resultin\n loss, alteration, unavailability or improper use or disclosure of data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships withthird-party\n partners, result in regulatory investigations and other proceedings, private claims, demands, litigation and other proceedings, loss of our ability to accept creditor\n debit card payments, increased card processing fees, and other significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure and lead to loss of driver or rider confidence in, ordecreased\n use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any actual or perceived privacy or securitybreach or incident imp\nacting any entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers, third party autonomous vehicleproviders,\n or other parties with whom we have agreed to share our data under licensing or other commercial arrangements) could have similar effects. In addition, anyactual\n or perceived privacy or security breach or incident impacting any autonomous vehicles, whether through our platform or our competitors\u2019, could result in legal,regulatory\n and financial exposure and lead to loss of rider confidence in our platform, which could significantly undermine our business strategy. Further, any cyberattacksdirected\n toward, or privacy or security breaches or incidents impacting, our competitors could reduce confidence in the ridesharing industry as a whole and, as a result,reduce confidence in us.\nWe\n incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents and we expect our costs will increase as wecontinue\n to implement systems and processes designed to prevent and otherwise address security breaches and incidents. In the event of a future breach or incident, wecould be\n required to expend additional significant capital and other resources in an effort to respond to prevent further breaches or incidents, which may require us to divertsubstantial resources.\n30\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
