Any of these consequencescould adversely\n affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligationsto indemnify and to incur l\negal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.A\n determination  in,  or  settlement  of,  any  legal  proceeding,  whether  we  are  party  to  such  legal  proceeding  or  not,  that  involves  our  industry,  could  harm  ourbusiness,\n financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or no\nt, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In\n addition, we regularly include arbitration  provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform.  These provisions are intended tostreamline\n the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,arbitration\n may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain\n risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand,\n we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litiga\ntion costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further,\n with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw,\n there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If ourarbitration agreements were found to be\n unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein\n our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.As\n we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand\n regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.\nAs\n we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction\n to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate oraddress the unique issues fac\ned by our industry.For\n example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws andregulations.\n These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf ofhealthcare\n partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the costsassociated\n with  our  offerings  to  healthcare  partners.  With  respect  to  our  healthcare  rides  matched  through  the  Lyft  Platform  and  provided  to  Medicaid  or  MedicareAdvantage\n beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws could lead to ourloss\n of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.Further,\n we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain riskssuch as the government\u2019s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector\u2019s budgetary cycles and funding aut\nhorization, and the government\u2019s administrative andinvestigatory processes.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulation\ns and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings orplatform\n could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party\n providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our platform offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,discourage\n new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of rider fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or privateclaims and litigat\nion, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face the risk of litigat\nion resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.The\n actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws.For example,\n the TCPA restricts certain telemarketing and the use of certain automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted and may in the futureresult\n in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving anddeveloping.\n If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.45\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
