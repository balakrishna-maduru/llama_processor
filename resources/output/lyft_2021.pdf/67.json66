When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would\n be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod\n of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter. The amount of thedeferral\n will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance\n Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod\n to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including\n any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance\n Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove\n over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges\n to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent\n period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date\n back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated\n to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation\n of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.\n As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidatedstatement of operations.\nWe\n had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economicchallenges\n resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business. We believe the costs associated with the restructuring do not reflect current periodperformance\n of  our  ongoing  operations.  We  believe  the  adjustment  to  exclude  the  costs  related  to  restructuring  from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  toinvestors\n by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current period results and provide for better comparability with our historicallydisclosed Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA amounts.\nFor\n more information regarding the limitations of Contribution and Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of revenue to Contribution, see the section titled\"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measu\nres\".Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key\n performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operatingleverage\n in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate  internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a moreconsistent basis, we use these m\neasures for business planning purposes. We expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin will increase over the long term as wecontinue to scale our business \nand achieve greater efficiencies in our operating expenses.We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as ne\nt loss, adjusted for:\u2022\ninterest expense; \u2022\nother income (expense), n et;\u2022\nprovision for (benefit f rom) income taxes;\u2022\ndepreciation and amortization; \u2022\nstock-based compensation exp ense;\u2022\npayroll tax expense rel ated to stock-based compensation;\u2022\nchanges to the liabilities f or insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022\nsublease income; \u2022\ncosts related to acquis itions and divestitures, if any;\u2022\ntransaction costs related to  certain legacy auto insurance liability, if any; and\u2022\nrestructuring charges, if any.Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by d\nividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period.67\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
