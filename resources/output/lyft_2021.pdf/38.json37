Any changes in such systems and application  marketplaces  that degrade the functionality  of our apps or give preferential  treatment  to ourcompetitors\u2019\n apps could adversely affect our platform\u2019s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us frommaking\n our  apps  available  to  drivers  and  riders,  make  changes  that  degrade  the  functionality  of  our  apps,  increase  the  cost  of  using  our  apps,  impose  terms  of  useunsatisfactory\n to us or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 placement in such mobile operating systems\u2019application marketplace\n is more prominent than the placement of our apps, overall growth in our rider or driver base could slow. Our apps have experienced fluctuations innumber of downloads in the past, and we\n anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will contin\nue to support our platform or effectively rollout\n updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our offerings are designed to work effectively with a range of mobiletechnologies,\n systems,  networks  and  standards.  We  may  not  be  successful  in  developing  or  maintaining  relationships  with  key  participants  in  the  mobile  industry  thatenhance drivers\u2019\n and riders\u2019 experience. If drivers or riders on our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are unableto adapt to changes in popular \nmobile operating systems, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We depend on the interoperability of our plat\nform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.We have integrations with a variety of productivity, collaboration, travel, data management and security ve\nndors. As our offerings expand and evolve, including tothe\n extent we continue to develop autonomous technology, we may have an increasing number of integrations with other third-party applications, products and services.Third-party\n applications, products and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party\n offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or technology partners may take actions which disrupt the interoperability of ourplatform\n with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we operate and distribute our platform. As ourrespective\n products  evolve,  we  expect  the  types  and  levels  of  competition  to  increase.  Should  any  of  our  competitors  or  technology  partners  modify  their  products,standards\n or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment tocompetitive products or s\nervices, our products, platform, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Defects, errors or\n vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems or other technology systems and those of third-party technology providers, or system failures andresulting\n interruptions in our availability or the availability of other systems and providers, could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business,financial condition and results of operations.\nThe\n software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after thecode\n has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u201ccontinuous deployment,\u201d which refers to the frequent release of our software code,sometimes\n multiple times per day. This practice increases the risk that errors and vulnerabilities are present in the software code underlying our platform. The third-partysoftware\n that  we  incorporate  into  our  platform  may  also  be  subject  to  errors  or  vulnerability.  Any  errors  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  from  third-partysoftware\n after  release  could  result  in  negative  publicity,  a  loss  of  users  or  loss  of  revenue  and  access  or  other  performance  issues.  Such  vulnerabilities  could  also  beexploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of u\nsers on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or incident. We may need to expend significantfinancial\n and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely andeffectively\n resolve any such errors, defects or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as negatively impactour reputation or brand.\nFurther,\n our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defectsor\n malfunctions,  distributed  denial-of-service  and  other  cyberattacks,  human  error,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  floods,  fires,  natural  disasters,  power  losses,  disruptions  intelecommunications\n services,  fraud,  military  or  political  conflicts,  terrorist  attacks,  computer  viruses,  ransomware,  malware  or  other  events.  Our  systems  also  may  besubject\n to break-ins, sabotage, theft and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disasterrecovery\n planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result frominterruptions in our servi\nce as a result of systems failures and similar events.We have experienced and \nwill likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability orreduce or affect th\ne speed or functionality of our offerings.
