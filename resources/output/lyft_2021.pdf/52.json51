For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have been filed inCalifornia\n state and federal courts and derivative actions have been filed in Delaware and California federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, andcertain\n of  the  underwriters  named  in  our  IPO  Registration  Statement  alleging  violation  of  securities  laws,  breach  of  fiduciary  duties,  and  other  causes  of  action  inconnection\n with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of our man\nagement\u2019s attention and resources.Sales\n of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception  that such sales have or could occur, could depress the market price of our Class Acommon stock.\nThe\n market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and theperception\n that  these  sales  have  or  could  occur  may  also  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  including  if  there  is  short-selling  or  other  hedgingtransactions.\nWe have\n filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable\n exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United Stat\nes in the open market.Sales of our\n Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Thesesales could also cause the \ntrading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.Delaware\n law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxycontest difficult, thereby d\nepressing the market price of our Class A common stock.Our\n status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol\n by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which theperson\n became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation and amended \nand restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\u2022\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws require the approval of at least two-thirds of ourthen-outstanding voting power;\n\u2022\nour dual class common stock structure, which provides our Co-Founders, individually or together, with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of mattersrequiring\n stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B commonstock;\n\u2022\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\u2022\nour stockholders are only able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and are not able to take action by written consent for any matter;\u2022\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\u2022\nvacancies on our board of directors are able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\u2022\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or a majority ofour board of directors;\n\u2022\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;52\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
