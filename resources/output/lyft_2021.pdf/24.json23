Such factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate thereserves\n for claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, andmay\n encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses forclaims\n and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determinethat\n our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to ournet\n loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the adverse development toinsurance\n reserves we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021 was largely attributable to historical auto losses that are associated with accident liabilities between 2018and 2020.\nWe\n rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance claims toour expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financia\nl condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a\n limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims. If any of our third-party insurance service providers failsto\n service claims to our expectations, discontinues or increases the cost of coverage or changes the terms of such coverage in a manner not favorable to drivers or to us, wecannot\n guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage or services on reasonable terms in an acceptable time frame or at all. If we cannot find alternatethird-party insurance s\nervice providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal resources.We\n may, from time to time, explore the possibility of selling portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties. This may cause us to incur additional expenses inthe\n total  cost  of  this  risk.  For  example,  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2020,  we  entered  into  a  Novation  Agreement  to  transfer  nearly  all  of  our  primary  auto  insuranceliabilities\n related  to  periods  preceding  October  2018  to  a  third-party,  in  October  2020,  we  expanded  our  rideshare  insurance  program  to  include  additional  third-partyinsurance-service\n providers,  and  in  April  2021,  we  executed  an  agreement  to  reinsure  our  captive  insurance  entity  for  $183  million  of  coverage  above  the  insuranceliabilities\n recorded as of March 31, 2021 for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020. We are subject to recapture of the risk if ourthird party reinsurer we\nre to default on their reinsurance obligation.Any\n negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead toincreased regulatory o\nr litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain andcontinue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network effectsamong the\n drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.
