After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South  Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain  states have enacted laws thatwould\n require tax reporting, collection or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which wouldharm\n our business. New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audi\nt requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As\n a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference\n may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.\nOperating as\n a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our managementteam have limited exper\nience managing a public company.As\n a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to thereporting requirements of the\n Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, therules\n and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  the  listing  standards  of  the  Nasdaq  Stock  Market.  For  example,  the  Exchange  Act  requires,  among  other  things,  we  file  annual,quarterly\n and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls andprocedures\n and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financialcompliance\n costs,  and  increase  demand  on  our  systems.  In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  may  be  subject  to  stockholder  activism,  which  can  lead  to  additionalsubstantial\n costs,  distract  management  and  impact  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business  in  ways  we  cannot  currently  anticipate.  As  a  result  of  disclosure  ofinformation\n in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation,including by competitors.\nCertain\n members  of  our  management  team  have  limited  experience  managing  a  publicly  traded  company,  interacting  with  public  company  investors  andcomplying\n with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being apublic\n company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts andinvestors.\n These  obligations  and  constituents  will  require  significant  attention  from  our  senior  management  and  could  divert  their  attention  away  from  the  day-to-daymanagement of our business, which \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change may have a long-term i\nmpact on our business.We have established environmental programs, such as our\n commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure theefficient\n use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks whereverbusiness\n is conducted.  For example,  our San Francisco,  California  headquarters  is projected  to  be vulnerable  to future  water  scarcity  and sea level  rise  due to climatechange,\n as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weatherevents\n and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of ourcustomers,\n and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climatechange policies\n such as California\u2019s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meetthe\n future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. We advocate for EVprograms\n that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such programs to address EV capital costs, EV chargingcosts,\n and  EV  charging  infrastructure  in  the  context  of  transportation  network  companies\u2019  unique  needs  could  challenge  our  ability  to  progress  toward  our  100%  EVcommitment.\n Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,depreciation,\n asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise notsuccessful,\n our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. We may also enter into arrangements with thirdparties\n for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030. Such transactions may require us toprovide\n guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to usethem, we may not realiz\ne the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.Risks Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\nWe may require additional capital, which ma\ny not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.Historically,\n we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. Tosupport our\n growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential new offerings. In May 2020,we issued $747.5 million in aggrega\nte principal amount47\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
