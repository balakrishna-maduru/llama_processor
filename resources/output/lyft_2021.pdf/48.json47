If we raise additional funds through theissuance\n of equity,  equity-linked  or debt  securities,  such  as our  2025  Notes, those  securities  may have  rights,  preferences  or  privileges  senior  to those  of  our Class  Acommon\n stock,  and  our  existing  stockholders  may  experience  dilution.  Further,  we  have  secured  debt  financing  which  has  resulted  in  fixed  obligations  and  certainrestrictive\n covenants,  and any  debt financing  secured  by  us in  the future  would result  in increased  fixed  obligations  and could  involve  additional  restrictive  covenantsrelating\n to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, as well as liens on some or all of our assets, which may make it more difficult for us toobtain additional capi\ntal and to pursue business opportunities.We\n evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, businessplans\n and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Additionally, COVID-19 may impact our access to capital andmake\n additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorableterms,\n or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our businessgrowth and to respond to business chall\nenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, or if we enter into strategic transactions that do not achieveour objectives, our business, results of operations and financial \ncondition could be adversely affected.As\n part  of  our  business  strategy,  we  will  continue  to  consider  a  wide  array  of  potential  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  of  businesses,  newtechnologies,\n services  and  other  assets  and  strategic  investments  that  complement  our  business,  such  as  our  acquisition  of  Flexdrive  in  February  2020,  as  well  asdivestitures,\n partnerships and other transactions. We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets and other opportunities that operate in relatively nascentmarkets.\n As we grow, we also may explore investments in new technologies, which we may develop or other parties may develop. We may also explore acquisitions, jointventures,\n or  other  strategic  partnerships  that  result  in  our  products  or  services  entering  new  markets.  There  is  no  assurance  that  such  acquired  businesses  will  besuccessfully\n integrated into our business or generate substantial revenue, that our investments in other technologies will generate returns for our business, or that we willnot lose our initial inves\ntment with strategic investments.Acquisitions involve numerous risks, \nany of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\u2022\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase acquisition costs and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable oracceptable terms;\n\u2022\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\u2022\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain indemnification or representation and warranty insurance;\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company;\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities;\u2022\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\u2022\nfailure  to  identify  the  problems,  liabilities  or  other  shortcomings  or  challenges  of  an  acquired  company  or  technology,  including  issues  related  to  intellectualproperty, regulatory com\npliance practices, litigation, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\u2022\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired company or business;\u2022\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\u2022\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new offerings cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\u2022\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.In\n addition, we may divest businesses or assets or enter into joint ventures, strategic partnerships or other strategic transactions. For example, in July 2021, weclosed\n the  sale  of  our  Level  5  self-driving  vehicle  division.  These  types  of  transactions  present  certain  risks;  for  example,  we  may  not  achieve  the  desired  strategic,operational\n and  financial  benefits  of  a  divestiture,  partnership,  joint  venture  or  other  strategic  transaction.
