Net Loss Per ShareBasic net loss per share is co\nmputed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject\n to repurchase.  The diluted  net loss per  share  is computed  by giving  effect  to all  potentially  dilutive  common  stock equivalents  outstanding  for  the period.  Forpurposes\n of this calculation, redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, PSUs, the 2025 Notes, restricted stock awards, stock purchase rights grantedunder\n the Company\u2019s ESPP and early exercised stock options are considered to be common stock equivalents but are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss pershare when including them has an anti-diluti\nve effect. Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the sameliquidation and dividend righ\nts.The following table sets for\nth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Net loss\n$ (1,009,359) $ (1,752,857) $ (2,602,241) Weighted-average sha\nres used in computing net loss per share, basic and diluted334,724 312,175 227,498 Net loss per share, basic and di\nluted$ (3.02) $ (5.61) $ (11.44) The following potentially\n dilutive outstanding shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because includingthem\n would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of theperiod (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 2025 Notes\n19,471 19,471 \u2014 Restricted stock units\n16,285 33,428 41,685 Stock options\n1,105 1,919 2,957 Performance based rest\nricted stock units831 175 \u2014 ESPP\n115 89 \u2014 Restricted stock awards\n\u2014 \u2014 94 Total\n37,807 55,082 44,736 _______________\n(1)\nIn  connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company entered into Capped Calls, which were not included for purposes of calculating the number of diluted shares outstanding, astheir\n effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Capped Calls are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2025 Notes issettled in\n cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2025 Notes the Company's common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2025Notes.\n15.
