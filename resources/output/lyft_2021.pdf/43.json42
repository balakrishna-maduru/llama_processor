The laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States and effectiveintellectual\n property  protections  may  not  be  available  or  may  be  limited  in  foreign  countries.  Our  domestic  and  international  intellectual  property  protection  andenforcement\n strategy is influenced by many considerations including costs, where we have business operations, where we might have business operations in the future,legal\n protections available in a specific jurisdiction, and/or other strategic considerations. As such, we do not have identical or analogous intellectual property protection inall\n jurisdictions, which could risk freedom to operate in certain jurisdictions if we were to expand. As we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorizeduse,\n copying,  transfer  and  disclosure  of  proprietary  information  will  likely  increase.  We  may  need  to  expend  additional  resources  to  protect,  enforce  or  defend  ourintellectual\n property rights domestically  or internationally,  which could impair our business or adversely affect our domestic or international  operations. We enter intoconfidentiality\n and  invention  assignment  agreements  with  our  employees  and  consultants  and  enter  into  confidentiality  agreements  with  our  third-party  providers  andstrategic\n partners.  We  cannot  assure  you  that  these  agreements  will  be  effective  in  controlling  access  to,  and  use  and  distribution  of,  our  platform  and  proprietaryinformation.\n Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ourofferings.\n Competitors and other third parties may also attempt to reverse engineer our data which would compromise our trade secrets and other rights. We also enter intostrategic partnerships, joint\n development and other similar agreements with third parties where intellectual property arising from such partnerships may be jointly-owned ormay\n be transferred or licensed to the counterparty. Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights,including\n requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectualproperty\n rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect thevalue of the jointly-owned in\ntellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.We\n may  be  required  to  spend  significant  resources  in  order  to  monitor  and  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  some  violations  may  be  difficult  orimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights coul\nd be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in theimpairment\n or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuitsattacking the\n validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology against unauthorizedcopying or use,\n as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductionsof\n enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may berequired\n to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable termsor at all and could advers\nely affect our ability to compete.Our\n industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle technology, including by foreign actors.We,\n along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although wetake\n measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be underminedand our business, financial cond\nition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.Changes in laws or regulations relatin\ng to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply withsuch\n laws  and  regulations  or  any  other  obligations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  or  the  protection  or  transfer  of  personal  data,  could  adversely  affect  ourbusiness.\nWe\n receive,  transmit  and  store  a  large  volume  of  personally  identifiable  information  and  other  data  relating  to  the  users  on  our  platform.  Numerous  local,municipal, state,\n federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certaintypes\n of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault ofNon-Solicited\n Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health InsurancePortability\n and  Accountability  Act  of  1996,  or  HIPAA,  Section  5(c)  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  or  CCPA,  and  theCalifornia Privacy Rights Act,\n or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, \namendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA\n will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The\n CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain\n unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compl\niance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, other states have considered or have enacted legislation similar to the CCPA and CPRA. For example,on\n March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Coloradoenacted\n the Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA, which takes effect on July 1, 2023. These new and modified state laws, including the CPRA, and other changes in laws orregulations\n relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certaintypes of data or new obligations wi\nth regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require43\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
