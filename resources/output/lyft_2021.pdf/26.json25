If  any  of  our  third-party  background  check  providers  terminates  itsrelationship\n with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to securesimilar\n terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we maynot\n be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by ourthird-party\n background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted toprovide rides on our platfor\nm, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.We are\n also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing drivers on our platform. If we or drivers on ourplatform fail to co\nmply with applicable laws, rules and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Any\n negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or data security breaches orincidences,\n could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks couldadversely affect our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our abil\nity to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand\n for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors,\n including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect\n our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle. We havetested\n or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. Wehave also modified,\n and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimatelybe successful in attra\ncting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in negative public perception and harm to our reputation.While\n we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately beunsuccessful. A\n determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform\n as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opp\nortunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional\n costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in\n the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified\n drivers. Moreover, successful  litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the reclassification  of drivers on our platform  as employees  could reduce the availablesupply\n of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance\n supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing\n or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue tolaunch\n new  and  develop  existing  asset-intensive  offerings  such  as  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  Driver  Hubs,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,Express\n Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect ourpricing\n methodologies. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may alsoaffect our pricing.
