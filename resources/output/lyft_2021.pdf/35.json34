If we are unable to develop and grow our delivery service platform, or unable to do so cost-effectively, whether as a result of our own actions ormarket conditions more g\nenerally, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our\n metrics and estimates, including the key metrics included in this report, are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies inthose metrics may harm our reputation and negative\nly affect our business.We regularly\n review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics used to evaluate our growth, measure our performance and make strategic decisions.These\n metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been evaluated by a third-party. Our metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties orfrom\n similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology or the assumptions on which we rely, and we may make material adjustments to ourprocesses\n for calculating our metrics in order to enhance accuracy, because better information becomes available or other reasons, which may result in changes to ourmetrics.\n The estimates and forecasts we disclose relating to the size and expected growth of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets inwhich\n we compete meet the size estimates and growth we have forecasted, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. If investors or analysts do not considerour\n metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, then the trading price of our Class A common stock andour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effe\nctive.Promoting\n awareness of our offerings is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new qualified drivers and new riders and can be costly. Webelieve\n that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts includereferrals, affiliate\n programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising, television, billboards, radio, video, content, direct mail, social media, email, hiring andclassified\n advertisement  websites,  mobile  \u201cpush\u201d  communications,  search  engine  optimization  and  keyword  search  campaigns.  Our  marketing  initiatives  may  becomeincreasingly\n expensive and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketingefforts, it may not offs\net the additional marketing expenses we incur.If\n our marketing efforts are not successful in promoting awareness of our offerings or attracting new qualified drivers and new riders, or if we are not able to cost-effectively\n manage our marketing expenses, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If our marketing efforts are successful in increasing awareness of ourofferings,\n this could also lead to increased public scrutiny of our business and increase the likelihood of third parties bringing legal proceedings against us. Any of theforegoing risks could harm our bus\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Any\n failure to offer high-quality user support may harm our relationships with users and could adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial conditionand results of operations.\nOur\n ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders is dependent in part on the ease and reliability of our offerings, including our ability to provide high-quality\n support. Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leavingsomething\n in a driver\u2019s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retainservice\n providers  who  are  qualified  to  support  users  and  sufficiently  knowledgeable  regarding  our  offerings.  As  we  continue  to  grow  our  business  and  improve  ourofferings,\n we will face challenges related to providing quality support services at scale. If we grow our international rider base and the number of international drivers onour\n platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English. Furthermore, theCOVID-19 pandemic\n may impact our ability to provide effective and timely support, including as a result of a decrease in the availability of service providers and increasein\n response time. Any failure to provide efficient user support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation,brand, business, financial cond\nition and results of operations.Failure to deal effectiv\nely with fraud could harm our business.We\n have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, claims ofunauthorized\n payments by a rider, attempted payments by riders with insufficient funds and fraud committed by riders in concert with drivers. Bad actors use increasinglysophisticated\n methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person\u2019s identity, account information or paymentinformation\n and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information and mobile phone numbers and accounts. Under current cardpayment practices, we may be liable\n for rides facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit cardtransaction. Despite measures that we have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraud\nulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot guarantee that anyof our measures will be ef\nfective or35\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
