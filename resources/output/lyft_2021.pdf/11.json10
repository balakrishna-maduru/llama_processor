Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.\u2022\nOngoing criminal  monitoring.  Continuous criminal  monitoring  allows us to quickly deactivate  drivers with disqualifying  criminal  convictions.  We also checkdriving records throughout the y\near to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.\u2022\nMandatory safety education.  Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These\n programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and \nreporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\u2022\nEmergency help, supported by ADT. If  a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with anADT security professional.\n\u2022\nHidden contact information and ride history. The  Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While ridersand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, incl\nuding real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not ableto see a rider\u2019s drop-of\nf location, whether it\u2019s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\u2022\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider ordriver\n who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never bematched with that individu\nal again through the app.In 2021,\n we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which ar\ne statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips\n in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and ourgoal is to make each Lyft \nride as safe as we possibly can.Government Regulation\nWe\n are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such asTNCs,\n public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentialityobligations,\n product  liability,  defects,  recalls,  auto  maintenance  and  repairs,  personal  injury,  text  messaging,  subscription  services,  intellectual  property,  securities,consumer\n protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions,terms\n of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medicaltransportation,\n healthcare  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,  environmental  health  and  safety,  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  background  checks,  public  health,  anti-corruption,  anti-bribery,\n political contributions, lobbying, import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls anddelivery\n of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in manycases\n due  to  their  lack  of  specificity.  As  a  result,  their  application  in  practice  may  change  or  develop  over  time  through  judicial  decisions  or  as  new  guidance  orinterpretations ar\ne provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The\n TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specificallyincreasing\n greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  In  2018,  California  passed  first-of-its-kind  legislation  (the  \u201cCalifornia  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program\u201d)  tomandate\n that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emissionvehicles\n on their  platforms.  Policymakers  recently  proposed analogous  legislation  in Washington  and Oregon.  Other states  are  actively  observing  the California  CleanMiles Standard and Incentiv\ne Program as well.See\n the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d including the subsections titled \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\u2014Challenges to contractorclassification\n of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related toRegulatory\n and Legal Factors\u2014Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws andregulations could\n harm our business, financial conditions and results of operations,\u201d \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Operational Factors\u2014We rely on third-party paymentprocessors\n to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such third parties and otherpayment-related\n risks,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected,\u201d  \u201cRisk  Factors\u2014Risks  Related  to  Regulatory  and  LegalFactors\u2014Changes in laws\n or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to complywith such laws and regulations or any o\nther obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could11\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
