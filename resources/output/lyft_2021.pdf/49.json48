In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, whichis\n now  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Loan  and  Security  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  a  third-party  lender,  aMaster\n Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party;\n and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements. See Note 10 \"Debt\" to ourconsolidated\n financial statements, for further information on these agreements and our outstanding debt obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $711.4 million ofindebtedness for borrowed money outs\ntanding.Our ability to make schedul\ned payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subjectto\n economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service ourdebt\n and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring\n debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or futureindebtedness\n will  depend  on the  capital  markets  and  our  financial  condition  at  such  time.  We  may  not  be  able  to  engage  in  any  of  these  activities  or  engage  in  theseactivities\n on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants thatmay\n prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, couldresult in the accel\neration of our debt.In\n addition,  our  indebtedness,  combined  with  our  other  financial  obligations  and  contractual  commitments,  could  have  other  important  consequences.  Forexample, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in governmentregulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\u2022\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.Further,\n as  of  January  1,  2022,  LIBOR  settings  for  all  non-U.S.  dollar  currencies  and  U.S.  dollar  one-week  and  two-month  LIBOR  settings  ceased  beingpublished,\n provided or representative. InterContinental Benchmark Exchange and the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority have confirmed that LIBOR settingsfor all\n remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease to be published, provided or representative after June 30, 2023. If new methods of calculating LIBOR are establishedor if other benchmark rates\n used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments, including the terms ofFlexdrive\u2019s debt instrumen\nts, may be negatively impacted, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected interest income.In\n addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary\u2019s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenantsregarding our\n business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive\u2019s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions.If\n we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or consent from the lenders,then,\n subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involveadditional\n restrictive  covenants  relating  to  our  capital-raising  activities  and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtainadditional capital\n to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay ourloans immediately, and \nmay limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.49\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
