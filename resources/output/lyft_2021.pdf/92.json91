If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable,\n which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\nThe\n Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\nLevel 1\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\nLevel\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market \nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying\n values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.\nLight Vehicle Fleet\nThe\n Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand\n other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 3\n1, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9\n million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin\n service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively. Bikes are \nincluded in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.Leases\nThe\n Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019. TheCompany\n elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical assessments of(1) whether\n contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is orcontains\n a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. TheCompany\n determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leasesor\n subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, theCompany classifies the\n lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):\u2022\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;\u2022\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;\u2022\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economiclife of the underlying ass\net;\u2022\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or\u2022\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.92\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
