The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and proceduresand\n internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information requiredto be disclosed\n by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and formsand\n that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We arealso continuing\n to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order tomaintain and improve th\ne effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.Our\n current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increasedcomplexity\n resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19 and permanent work-from-home\n and  hybrid  work  arrangements,  new  offerings  on  our  platform  or  from  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  and  divestitures.  Further,  weaknesses  in  ourdisclosure\n controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficultiesencountered\n in  their  implementation  or  improvement,  could  harm  our  results  of  operations  or  cause  us  to  fail  to  meet  our  reporting  obligations  and  may  result  in  arestatement\n of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adverselyaffect\n the  results  of  periodic  management  evaluations  and  annual  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  attestation  reports  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  ourinternal\n control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control overfinancial reporting could\n also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of ourClass A common stock. In addition, if we \nare unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.Our independent\n registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control overfinancial\n reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have anadverse effect on our busin\ness, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.Taxing\n authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, gross receipts, value added or similar taxes andmay\n successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments or obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as\n sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to businesses like ours andto drivers is a complex\n and evolving issue. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of theInternet\n and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates andare\n subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or todrivers\u2019 businesses.\nIn\n addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislativeaction\n to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically onTNC rides.\n As one example, voters in San Francisco approved \u201cProposition D\u201d in November of 2019, which imposes a percentage-based tax on TNC rides originating inthe city.\n Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, andwe\n may face indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raisedand may\n continue to raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictionsin\n which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more taxauthorities requiring\n us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes,could\n result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing ourofferings\n or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Although  we  have  reserved  for  potential  payments  of  possible  past  taxliabilities in our financial stateme\nnts, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Additionally,\n one  or  more  states,  localities  or  other  taxing  jurisdictions  may  seek  to  impose  additional  reporting,  record-keeping  or  indirect  tax  collectionobligations\n on businesses like ours. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,collect and remit indirect taxes f\nor transactions taking place46\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
