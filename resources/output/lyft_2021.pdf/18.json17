These impacts to the demand for and operations of the different rental programs have and may continue to adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operation.\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay or prevent us, or our current or prospective partners and suppliers, from being able to test, develop or deploy autonomousvehicle-related\n technology,  including  through  direct  impacts  of  the  COVID-19  virus  on  employee  and  contractor  health;  reduced  consumer  demand  forautonomous vehicle\n travel resulting from an overall reduced demand for travel; shelter-in-place orders by local, state or federal governments negatively impactingoperations,\n including our ability to test autonomous vehicle-related technology; impacts to the supply chains of our current or prospective partners and suppliers;or\n economic  impacts  limiting  our  or  our  current  or  prospective  partners\u2019  or  suppliers\u2019  ability  to  expend  resources  on  developing  and  deploying  autonomousvehicle-related\n technology.  These  impacts  to  the  development  and  deployment  of  autonomous  vehicle-related  technology  may  adversely  affect  our  business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.\u2022\nIn response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we have had to take certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salaryreductions, which\n may have adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. As the severity, magnitude and durationof\n the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic\u2019simpact\n on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remainsuncertain\n and difficult to predict. As the pandemic continues, the recovery of the economy and our business have fluctuated and varied by geography. Further, theultimate\n impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that arenot\n within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to thepandemic\n (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto onlocal\n or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;evolving\n laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key marketsand financial market volatility;\n volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent ofany virus mutations or new stra\nins of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\u2022\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural d\nisasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.A significant\n natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, theInternet\n or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known forseismic\n activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,other\n epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or other catastrophic events,whether\n in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine\n that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or ourthird-party\n providers\u2019 abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.A deterioration of general macroeconomi\nc conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and\n results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders. A deterioration ofgeneral\n macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slower  growth  or  recession,  inflation,  changes  to  fuel  and  other  energy  costs  or  vehicle  costs,  or  decreases  in  consumerspending\n power or confidence may harm our results of operations. Economic  weakness or uncertainty, and constrained consumer spending have in the past resulted in, andmay\n in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negativelyaffect\n our ability to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19pandemic,\n have, and may continue to, put pressure  on economic  conditions, which has led and could lead,  to reduced  demand for services  on our platform  or greateroperating\n expenses. For  example,  inflation  has  broadly  impacted  the  auto  service  industry,  which  has  increased  our  insurance  costs.  If  general  economic  conditionsdeteriorate\n in  the  United  States  or  in  other  markets  where  we  operate,  discretionary  spending  may  decline  and  demand  for  ridesharing  may  be  reduced.  An  economicdownturn resulting in a prolonged r\necessionary period may have a further adverse effect on our revenue.18\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
