As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had letters of credit outstanding of $53.1 million and $54.2million, respectively.\nIndemnification\nThe\n Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain business partners,investors,\n contractors, parties to certain acquisition or divestiture transactions and the Company\u2019s officers, directors and certain employees. The Company has agreed toindemnify\n and defend the indemnified party\u2019s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claimsbecause of the Company\u2019s act\nivities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine themaximum\n potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company\u2019s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved \nin each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is currently involved \nin, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary\n course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense\n related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,\n or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public di\nsclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related \nto accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes\n of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis\n reasonably  possible,  an estimate  of  the amount  of  loss or  range  of  losses  is not  possible  nor  is  the Company  able  to  estimate  the loss  or  range  of  losses that  couldpotentially\n result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classificat\nion MattersWith\n regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigation\ns and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers\n as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.\n Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can cr\neate uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For\n example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.  Labor  Code  sec.  2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new\n standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe\n independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,\n San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent\n contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits\n against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand\n material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia\n as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers\n utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied\n review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\n lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and\n PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.\n The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021. In September 2021, the Massachusetts Attorney Generalserved Lyft and Uber with a motion \nfor summary judgment on the issue of108\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
