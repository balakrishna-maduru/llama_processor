We regularly expand ourplatform\n features, offerings and services and change our pricing methodologies. In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused ourbusiness\n model. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks andchallenges we have faced o\nr expect to face include our ability to:\u2022\nforecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\u2022\nattract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\u2022\ncomply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\u2022\nmanage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions,including\n travel  bans,  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders,  as  well  as  maintain  demand  for  and  confidence  in  the  safety  of  our  platform  during  andfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nplan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles or certain vehicles in the Express Driveprogram and the fleet o\nf vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\u2022\ndevelop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, MobileServices, Lyft Auto Care, cert\nain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology;\u2022\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\u2022\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\u2022\neffectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\u2022\nsuccessfully expand our geographic reach;\u2022\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\u2022\nsuccessfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\u2022\nright-size our real estate portfolio.If\n we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this\u201cRisk\n Factors\u201d section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial model andoperate\n in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model oroperated\n in  a  more  predictable  market.  We  have  encountered  in  the  past,  and  will  encounter  in  the  future,  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by  growingcompanies\n with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate ourbusiness,\n are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial performance in recent periods may not b\ne indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Prior\n to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly andwe\n have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenuegrowth\n rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in themidst\n of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach\n of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the futu\nre, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
