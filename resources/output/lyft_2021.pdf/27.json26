For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing\n that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco\n continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A\n negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, couldadversely\n affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating\n due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals\n of bikes and scooters from March through October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  and again suspended rentals  of scooters from December  2020through February 2021 an\nd for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual\n region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are ableto\n successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe\n negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased\n number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or inciden\nts involving our competitors\u2019 offerings.We design and\n contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand\n scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will beable\n to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all. Wealso\n design  and  contract  to  manufacture  certain  assets  related  to  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  we  rely  on  a  small  number  of  suppliers  for  components  andmanufacturing services.\nThe\n supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes andscooters or\n key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in business conditio\nns, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond ourcontrol have affect\ned and could continue to affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.We incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing an\nd operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costsas\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our controlincluding\n market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial increases in prices of these assets or the cost of ouroperations\n would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, customsauthorities\n may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin determinations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff liabilities,including tariffs\n on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our financial statements,if these liabilit\nies exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Our\n bikes  and  scooters  or  components  thereof,  including  bikes  and  scooters  and  components  that  we  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  using  third-partysuppliers,\n have  experienced  and  may  in  the  future  experience  quality  problems,  product  issues  or  acts  of  vandalism  or  theft  from  time  to  time,  which  could  result  indecreased\n usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all product issues, vandalismor\n theft of our Light Vehicles. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, litigation or regulatory challenges, including personal injury or products liability claims, andharm to our reputation.\nThe revenue we generate from our network of Light Vehicles may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to, among other thing\ns, seasonal factors including weather.Our\n limited operating history makes it difficult for us to assess the exact nature or extent of the effects of seasonality on our network of Light Vehicles, however, wegenerally experience a decline in demand for our bike and scooter rentals over the winter seaso\nn and an increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Additionally, fromtime to time we may r\ne-evaluate the markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and27\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
