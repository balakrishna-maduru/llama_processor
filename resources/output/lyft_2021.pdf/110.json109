There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company\u2019s opinion, is likely tohave\n a  material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations;  however,  results  of  litigation  and  claims  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  legalproceedings\n related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.For\n example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating toalleged\n sexual  assault  or  harassment  by  drivers  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  a  Judicial  Council  Coordinated  Proceeding  has  been  created  before  the  Superior  Court  ofCalifornia, County of\n San Francisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending. Regardless of the outcome of these or other matters, litigation canhave\n an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.Although\n the Company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits, its chances of success on the merits are still uncertain as these matters are at various stages oflitigation\n and present a wide range of potential outcomes. The Company accrues for losses that may result from these matters when a loss is probable and reasonablyestimable.\nSecurities Litigation\nBeginning\n in  April 2019,  multiple  putative  class  actions  and derivative  actions  have  been filed  in state  and federal  courts  against  the Company,  its directors,certain\n of its officers, and certain of the underwriters named in the IPO Registration Statement alleging violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and othercauses\n of action in connection with the IPO. The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal\n court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand\n overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February26,\n 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint\n on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer\n but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion\n to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass\n action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part an\nd denied in part that motion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020,and\n the court certified the class action on August 20, 2021, and set trial to commence on December 5, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the parties informed the court they hadreached\n an agreement in principle to settle the case on a class-wide basis. In the consolidated derivative action, at the parties\u2019 joint request, the California federal courtstayed\n the case on February 17, 2021. Although the Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them, the Company hasaccrued amounts rela\nted to such matters when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general and administrative expenses.10.
