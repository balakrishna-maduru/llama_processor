Basis for Opinions\nThe\n Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits\n assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearingunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is\n to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reportingbased\n on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to beindependent\n with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB. Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\n about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was mai\nntained in all material respects.Our\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe\n amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as\n evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan\n understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our au\ndits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Webelieve that our audits p\nrovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor\ntingA\n company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial\n statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reportingincludes\n those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof\n the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally\n accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors\n of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019sassets that could have\n a material effect on the financial statements.Because\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures m\nay deteriorate.75\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
