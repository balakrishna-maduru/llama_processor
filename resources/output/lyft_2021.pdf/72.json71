We have adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing, and updating workplace\n policies. We also made adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenues including the transaction withWoven\n Planet  completed  on  July  13,  2021  and  headcount  reductions  in  2020.  Refer  to  Note  4  \"Divestitures\"  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  informationregarding the divestitu\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.We cannot be\n certain that our actions will mitigate some or all of the continuing negative effects of the pandemic on our business. With $2.3 billion in unrestrictedcash\n and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  believe  we  have  sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  our  working  capital  and  capitalexpenditures needs for the n\next 12 months and beyond.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, includin\ng, but not limited to our growth, our ability to maintain profitability on an Adjusted EBITDAbasis, our\n ability to attract and retain drivers and riders on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support ourefforts\n to develop our platform, actual insurance payments for which we have made reserves, measures we take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability tomaintain\n demand for and confidence in the safety of our platform during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Asnoted\n above, we expect to see continued suppression of demand for our platform and the resultant negative impacts on revenue for so long as the travel restrictions andother\n social  distancing  measures  in  response  to  COVID-19  remain  in  place.  Further,  we  may  in  the  future  enter  into  arrangements  to  acquire  or  invest  in  businesses,products,\n services  and  technologies.  For  example,  we  intend  to  significantly  invest  further  into  EVs  in  order  to  achieve  compliance  with  the  California  Clean  MilesStandard\n and Incentive Program which sets the target that 90% of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. Our investment also allows us to makesteps\n toward our commitment to reach 100% EVs on the Lyft Platform by the end of 2030. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fundcapital\n expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our ongoing operations, or to refinance our existing or future indebtedness. In the event that we decide, or arerequired,\n to seek additional financing from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capitalwhen desired, our business, financi\nal condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summar\nizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):Payments Due by Period\nTotal\n12 months or less Thereafter Operating lease commitments\n$ 317.8 $ 67.6 $ 250.2 Financing lease commitments\n28.7 14.0 14.7 Long-term debt, including cu\nrrent maturities711.5 56.3 655.2 Other noncancelable agreements\n120.3 46.8 73.5 _______________\n(1)\nThe table excludes insurance reserves due to uncertainties in the timing of sett lement of these reserves.We\n did  not  have  during  the  periods  presented,  and  we  do  not  currently  have,  any  off-balance  sheet  financing  arrangements  or  any  relationships  withunconsolidated\n entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for thepurpose of facilitating off-\nbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.(1)72\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
