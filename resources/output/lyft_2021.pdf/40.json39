If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operationsinternationally and a\nre unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.In\n addition, international expansion has increased our risks in complying with laws and standards in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including with respect tocustoms,\n anti-corruption, anti-bribery,  export controls and trade and economic sanctions. We cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions inviolation of applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible\n. In particular, any violation of the applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls andsimilar\n laws could result in adverse  media coverage,  investigations,  significant  legal fees, loss of export privileges,  severe criminal  or civil sanctions or suspension ordebarment\n from U.S. government contracts, and/or substantial diversion of management\u2019s attention, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand,business, financial condit\nion and results of operations.Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors\nOur\n business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe\n are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, publiccompanies,\n ridesharing,  worker  classification,  labor  and  employment,  anti-discrimination,  payments,  gift  cards,  whistleblowing  and  worker  confidentiality  obligations,product liability,\n defects, recalls, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, securities, consumer protection,taxation,\n privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, antitrust, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobileapplication\n accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, healthcarefraud, waste,\n and abuse, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, political contributions,lobbying,\n import and export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, foreign ownership and investment, foreign exchange controls and delivery of goods including (butnot\n limited  to)  medical  supplies,  perishable  foods  and  prescription  drugs  are  often  complex  and  subject  to  varying  interpretations,  in  many  cases  due  to  their  lack  ofspecificity.\n As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided byregulatory and governing bodies, su\nch as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The\n ridesharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012,the\n laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since beenadopted,\n were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharingmarketplace.\n We  have  been  proactively  working  with  federal,  state  and  local  governments  and  regulatory  bodies  to  ensure  that  our  ridesharing  marketplace  and  otherofferings\n are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address theunique\n issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted inresponse to our industry and related technologies\n. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courtsmay\n claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or thatusers on\n our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, includingairports,\n require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other compliance requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing,auto\n repair and collision services, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications forpermits,\n revoke existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties,including\n as  a  result  of  errors  in,  or  failures  to  comply  with,  reporting  or  other  requirements  related  to  our  product  offerings.  Any  of  the  foregoing  actions  by  thesejurisdictions and governmen\ntal entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Recent\n financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companiesengaged\n in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations thatare\n adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may viewmatters or interpret\n40\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
