Morgan  Securities  LLC  and  Credit  Suisse  Securities  (USA)  LLC,  as  representatives  of  the  several  initialpurchasers\n (the  \"Initial  Purchasers\")  in  a  private  placement  to  qualified  institutional  buyers  pursuant  to  Rule  144A  under  the  Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended  (the\u201cSecurities Act\u201d).\nThe\n 2025 Notes mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Companywith\n interest payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2020, at a rate of 1.50% per year. The net proceedsfrom this offering were \napproximately $733.2 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers\u2019 discounts and commissions and debt issuance costs.The\n initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 26.0491 shares of the Company's Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which isequivalent\n to an initial  conversion price  of approximately  $38.39 per share of the Class A common stock. The initial  conversion price  of the 2025 Notes represents  apremium of\n approximately 30% to the $29.53 per share closing price of the Company's Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 12, 2020. Theconversion rate is subjec\nt to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.The\n 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 15,2025, only under the following circu\nmstances:\u2022\nduring any fiscal quarter (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, for at least 20trading days (whether or not cons\necutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediatelypreceding fiscal quar\nter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\u2022\nduring the five  business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in theIndenture)\n per $1,000  principal  amount  of 2025 Notes  for each  trading  day of  the measurement  period  was less  than 98% of the product  of the lastreported sale price o\nf the Company's Class A common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day;\u2022\nif the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding theredemption date; or\n\u2022\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.On\n or after February 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder until the close of business on the second scheduled trading dayimmediately prec\neding the maturity date. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, sharesof\n the Company's Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election, in the manner andsubject to the terms and \nconditions provided in the Indenture.Holders of\n the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as definedin\n the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamentalchange\n (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2025 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of theprincipal amount of the Not\nes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.In\n accounting for the issuance of the 2025 Notes, the Company separated the 2025 Notes into a liability and an equity component. At the date of issuance, theCompany\n determined the fair value of the liability component to be $558.3 million calculated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the borrowing rate fora\n similar nonconvertible debt instrument. The equity component representing the conversion option was $189.2 million and was determined by deducting the fair value ofthe\n liability  component  from  the  par  value  of  the  2025  Notes.  The  equity  component  is  not  remeasured  as  long  as  it  continues  to  meet  the  conditions  for  equityclassification.\n The  difference  between  the  principal  amount  of  the  2025  Notes  and  the  liability  component  (\"debt  discount\")  is  amortized  to  interest  expense  over  thecontractual term at an effective interest\n rate of 8.0%.111\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
