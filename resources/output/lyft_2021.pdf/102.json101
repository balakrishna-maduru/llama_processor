The  Company  derecognized  $407.9  million  of  insurance  reservesliabilities\n and recognized a loss of $64.7 million for the net cost of the Novation on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with$62.5\n million in cost of revenue and $2.2 million in general and administrative expenses. In conjunction with the Novation, Clarendon and PVIC executed a RetrocessionAgreement, pursuant to which PVIC will re\ninsure Clarendon\u2019s losses related to the Legacy Auto Liability in excess of an aggregate limit of $816.0 million.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liabil\nity InsuranceOn\n April  22,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Pacific  Valley  Insurance  Company,  Inc.  (\u201cPVIC\u201d),  entered  into  a  Quota  Share  ReinsuranceAgreement\n (the \u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, basedon\n reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement,PVIC\n ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1,2020,\n with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheldbasis,\n meaning  that  funds  are  withheld  by  PVIC  from  the  insurance  premium  owed  to  DARAG in  order  to  pay  future  reinsurance  claims  on  DARAG\u2019s  behalf.  Uponconsummation\n of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurancerecoverable\n has been netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5 million for a $20.2 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued andother current liabilities on\n the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insuranceliabilities\n is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation. As of December 31, 2021, thebalance\n of  the  net  funds  withheld  liability  is  zero.  A  loss  of  approximately  $20.4  million  for  the  total  cost  of  the  Reinsurance  Transaction  was  recognized  on  theconsolidated statemen\nt of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.The\n Reinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder. Management evaluated reinsurance counterparty credit risk and doesnot consider it to be mat\nerial since the premium of $271.5 million was retained by PVIC on a funds withheld basis on behalf of the reinsurer.Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table sets for\nth the primary components of other income (expense), net as reported on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Year Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 2019 Interest income\n$ 9,074 $ 43,654 $ 102,506 Gain (loss) on sale of securi\nties, net687 (868) 246 Foreign currency exchange ga\nins (losses), net788 1,818 (523) Sublease income\n6,624 \u2014 \u2014 Gain from transaction with \nWoven Planet119,284 \u2014 \u2014 Other, net\n(524) (935) 366 Other income (expense), net\n$ 135,933 $ 43,669 $ 102,595 _______________\n(1)\nInterest income was reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statemen t of operations in periods prior to the second quarter of 2020.(1)102\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
