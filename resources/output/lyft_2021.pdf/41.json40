See the risk factor entitled \u201cChallenges to contractor classification ofdrivers\n that  use  our  platform  may  have  adverse  business,  financial,  tax,  legal  and  other  consequences  to  our  business.\u201d  Such  regulatory  scrutiny  or  action  may  createdifferent\n or  conflicting  obligations  from  one  jurisdiction  to  another,  and  may  have  a  negative  outcome  that  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  operations,  financialcondition,\n and results of operations. Additionally, we have invested and from time to time we will continue to invest resources in an attempt to influence or challengelegislation\n and  other  regulatory  matters  pertinent  to  our  operations,  particularly  those  related  to  the  ridesharing  industry,  which  may  negatively  impact  the  legal  andadministrative\n proceedings  challenging  the  classification  of  drivers  on  our  platform  as  independent  contractors  if  we  are  unsuccessful  or  lead  to  additional  costs  andexpenses\n even if we are successful. These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.\nOur industry is\n relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States an\nd Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For\n example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our\n ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The\n City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for\n our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich\n we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally,\n particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limi\ntations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise\n their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand\n employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory \nregimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could har\nm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classificat\nion of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat\n the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent\n contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent\n contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.  For  moreinformation\n regarding the litigation in which we have been involved, see the \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d subheading in Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes tothe\n Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, in 2021, the U.S. Secretary of Labor expressed his viewthat\n in  some  cases  \u201cgig  workers  should  be  classified  as  employees\u201d  and  that  further  review  was  ongoing.  We  continue  to  maintain  that  drivers  on  our  platform  areindependent contractors \nin such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to defend ourself vigorously in these matters, but our arguments may ultimatelybe\n unsuccessful. A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver of a ridesharingplatform as an employe\ne, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of:\u2022\nmonetary  exposure  arising  from  or  relating  to  failure  to  withhold  and  remit  taxes,  unpaid  wages  and  wage  and  hour  laws  and  requirements  (such  as  thosepertaining\n to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements),  expense reimbursement, statutory and punitivedamages, penalties, inc\nluding related to the California Private Attorneys General Act, and government fines;\u2022\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\u2022\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment;\u2022\nclaims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation under civil rights laws;\u2022\nclaims under new or existing laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining and other concerted activity;\u2022\nother  claims,  charges  or  other  proceedings  under  laws  and  regulations  applicable  to  employers  and  employees,  including  risks  relating  to  allegations  of  jointemployer liability o\nr agency liability; and41\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
