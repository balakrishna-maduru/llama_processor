Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion and results of operations.Our\n Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residualvalue related to the used car market \nvalues, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.For\n the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  ourExpress\n Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment\n to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat\n any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements,\n despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or\n Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises\n such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles\n in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has in\ncreased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The\n costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party\n resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue\n of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveaffected\n the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, arereportedly\n seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and  corresponding  residual  value  of  used  vehicles.  Areduction in\n residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require usto depreciate\n those vehicles at a more accelerated rate. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if we are unable to accurately forecastthe residual values of veh\nicles in the fleets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely  on  third-party  payment  processors  to  process  payments  made  by  riders  and  payments  made  to  drivers  on  our  platform,  and  if  we  cannot  manage  ourrelationships with such third parties and other payment-rela\nted risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any of ourthird-party\n payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find analternate\n payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and servicesprovided\n by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these riskscould\n cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could makeour platform less conve\nnient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.Nearly\n all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain paymentnetwork\n or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject toadditional operating ru\nles, regulations and risks. We may also be subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to the payments we accept from riders, includingwith respect\n to money laundering, money transfers, privacy, data protection and information security. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we may besubject\n to civil or criminal penalties, fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which couldmake\n our  offerings  less  convenient  and  attractive  to  riders.  If  any  of  these  events  were  to  occur,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  beadversely affected.\nFor\n example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enforcedby\n multiple  authorities  and  governing  bodies  in  the  United  States  and  numerous  state  and  local  agencies  who  may  define  money  transmitter  differently.  For  example,certain\n states may have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws,rules\n and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governingour\n business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with suchregulations, we may be subjec\nt to fines or other penalties in one or more32\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
