We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred,that\n insurance  will  continue  to  be  available  to  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all,  or  that  any  insurer  will  not  deny  coverage  as  to  any  future  claim.  Thesuccessful\n assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, includingpremium\n increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial conditionand results of operations.\nWe\n primarily  rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver  our offerings to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference  with our use of Amazon WebServices could adversely aff\nect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n currently host our platform and support our operations using Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We donot\n have control over the operations of the facilities of AWS that we use. AWS\u2019 facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurityattacks,\n terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Wehave\n experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,including\n infrastructure  changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS\u2019 service levels mayadversely affect our \nability to meet the requirements of users. Since our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeatedsystem\n failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peakusage\n times, as we expand and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and mayadversely affect th\ne usage of our offerings.Our commercial agreement with AWS will\n remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after January31,\n 2026, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or forfailure\n to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminatedor\n we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, newcloud\n infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, leadto\n a  significant  short  term  loss  of  revenue,  increase  our  costs  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of oper\nations.On\n February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least$350 million\n between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimumpurchase commitment du\nring any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  for  our  Express  Drive  program  and  Lyft  Rentals  program,  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleetmanagement\n and finance partners to support our Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties andother risks related to our Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, f\ninancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleet  management  and  finance  partners  to  supply  vehicles  todrivers\n for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates itsrelationship\n with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  beadversely\n impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.Similarly,\n in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result ofpublic\n health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners\u2019  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  becomeconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall\n affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft\u2019s rentalpartners.\n In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannotfind\n alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners\u2019 fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able tomeet\n the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to anumber\n of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost fromour\n Express  Drive  program  compared  to  the  corresponding  cost  from  the  rest  of  our  ridesharing  marketplace  offerings.  If  Flexdrive,  Lyft\u2019s  independently  managedsubsidiary, is unable\n to manage costs of operating Flexdrive\u2019s fleet and potential shortfalls between such costs and the rental fees collected from drivers, Lyft and Flexdrivemay update the pricing m\nethodologies related to Flexdrive\u2019s offering in31\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
