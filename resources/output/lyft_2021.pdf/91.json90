During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to theassets\n acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of theacquisition date.\n After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisitioncosts, such as legal and consult\ning fees, are expensed as incurred.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporatebonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity\n of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Alsoincluded\n in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,2021 and 2020, and money market deposit \naccounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted\n cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged\n to secure certain letters of credit.Investments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investme\nnts in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for the security,and\n the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt sec\nurities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The\n Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.  The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the cons\nolidated statements of operationsas\n an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore\n recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking\n this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating\n agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured\n based on  the  Company's best  estimate  of  the cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.  When  developing  its estimate  of  cash  flows expected  to  be collected,  theCompany\n considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.\nCredit\n loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidate\nd statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe\n amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2021, the Companyhad not recorded any credi\nt impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.The Company's investments in debt se\ncurities include:(i)\nCash  and  cash  equivalents. Cash  equivalents  include  certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an  originalmaturity of 90 days or less and \nare readily convertible to known amounts of cash.(ii)\nShort-term investments.  Short-term  investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which maturein twelve months or less. As a resul\nt, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.(iii)\nRestricted investments. Restricted investments are comprised of debt security investments in commercial  paper, certificates of deposit, corporatebonds\n and U.S. government securities which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insuranceproviders.\nNon-marketable Equity Securiti\nesThe\n Company has elected to measure its investments in non-marketable equity securities at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence ofobservable\n transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. The Company qualitatively assesses whether indicators of impairment exist.Factors\n considered in this assessment include the investees\u2019 financial and liquidity position, access to capital resources, exposure to industries and markets impacted byCOVID-19, and the time\n91\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
