Goodwill  isattributable\n to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (\u201cdeveloped technology\u201d intangible asset) and gaininggreater\n flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is a taxable businesscombination for tax purposes \nand goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.The\n fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of thedeveloped\n technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare\n avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were developed by discountingthese benefits to thei\nr present value.The\n results of operations for the acquired business have been included on the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company'sacquisition\n of  Flexdrive.  Flexdrive's  results  of  operations  for  periods  prior  to  this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and,accordingly, pro forma f\ninancial information has not been presented.Other Acquisitions\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, \nthe Company completed two business combinations which are not material to the consolidated financial statements.Pro\n forma  results  of  operations  have  not  been  presented  because  the  effects  of  the  acquisitions  were  not  material  to  the  Company\u2019s  consolidated  financialstatements.\n4. Divestitures\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. \n(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, the Company com\npleted a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets\n related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commerci\nalization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transa\nction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company\u2019s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting\n as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable\n to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare\n and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on therelative fair\n value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued usingan\n adjusted market approach.. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to estimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimatedmiles\n to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the stand alone selling price of the rideshare data. The gain was included in other income,net on\n96\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
