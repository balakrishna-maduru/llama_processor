We have scaled our business rapidly, and significant new initiatives have in the past resulted in, and in the future may result in,operational\n challenges affecting our business. In addition, developing and launching new offerings and enhancements to our existing offerings may involve significant up-front\n capital  investments  and such investments  may not generate  return on investment.  Further, from time to time we may reevaluate,  discontinue  and/or reduce theseinvestments\n and decide to discontinue one or more offerings. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualifieddrivers\n and riders, our ability to increase utilization of our offerings and our visibility into expected results of operations, and could adversely affect our business, financialcondition\n and results of operations. Additionally, since we are focused on building our community and ecosystems for the long-term, our near-term results of operationsmay be impacted by our inves\ntments in the future.If\n we  are  unable  to  successfully  manage  the  complexities  associated  with  our  expanding  multimodal  platform,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adversely affe\ncted.Our\n expansion into bike and scooter sharing, other modes of transportation, auto repair and collision services, vehicle rental programs and delivery services hasincreased the complexity of our\n business. These new offerings have required us to develop new expertise and marketing and operational strategies, and have subjected us tonew\n laws, regulations and risks. For example, we face the risk that our network of Light Vehicles, our Nearby Transit offering, which integrates third-party public transitdata\n into the Lyft App, and other future transportation offerings could reduce the use of our ridesharing offering. Additionally, from time to time we may reevaluate ourofferings\n on our multimodal platform and decide to discontinue an offering or certain features. Such actions may negatively impact revenue in the short term and may notprovide the benefits we expect in\n the long term. If we are unable to successfully manage the complexities associated with our expanding multimodal platform, including theeffects our new and evolving of\nferings have on our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our new delivery service platform \nmay not be successful and may expose us to additional risks.We\n are in the process of developing and assessing the feasibility of a business-to-business delivery service platform. This offering, which began in April 2020,currently\n allows businesses to send goods from one location to another. Drivers are provided the opportunity to opt-in to receive delivery requests and are currently paidbased on\n a delivery-specific pay structure. Delivery is not currently available in all markets and therefore not all drivers have the opportunity to receive delivery requests atthis time. We face a number \nof challenges that may affect the ultimate success of this offering, including:\u2022\nthe market for this offering may not be sustained following the COVID-19 pandemic, or may not develop at all;\u2022\nwe may be unable to attract and retain drivers for this offering, drivers currently using our platform may not opt-in to drive for this offering, or this offering maydivert drivers from our \nrideshare platform, which may create shortages of driver supply;\u2022\nwe may be unable to attract and retain businesses to participate in this offering;\u2022\nwe may fail to develop an effective pricing model for this offering that incentivizes drivers and businesses to use this offering while maintaining margins for us;\u2022\nour competitors may have more experience with respect to business or consumer deliveries, greater brand recognition in the delivery space, or greater financial orother\n resources that enable them to derive greater revenue, attract and retain drivers and businesses for their similar offerings, and more efficiently provide theirofferings;\n\u2022\nwe may incur additional costs and expenses associated with providing business or consumer delivery services, including insurance-related and other costs;\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation in a number of areas, including personal injury and automotive liability, and we may be unsuccessful in compelling to arbitrationclaims brought by drivers prov\niding rideshare and delivery services on the Lyft Platform;\u2022\nwe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are costly to comply with and may affect the profitability of this offering or our ability to offer delivery insome\n markets, including laws and regulations regarding pricing or driver benefits, and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations will adversely affectour deliveries offering;\n34\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
