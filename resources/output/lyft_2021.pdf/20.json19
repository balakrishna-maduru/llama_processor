These  efforts  may  be  more  costly  than  we  expect  and  may  not  result  inincreased\n revenue  or  growth  in  our  business.  For  example,  we  have  incurred  and  will  continue  to  incur  additional  costs  and  expenses  associated  with  the  passage  ofProposition 22 in California including provi\nding drivers in California with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards healthcare coverage,occupational\n accident insurance and minimum guaranteed earnings, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with theCOVID-19\n pandemic, including sales, marketing and costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we have expanded overtime\n to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light Vehicles, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and Lyft Auto Care. We are also expanding the supportavailable\n to drivers at our Driver Hubs, our driver-centric service centers and community spaces, Driver Centers, our vehicle service centers, Mobile Services, Lyft AutoCare,\n and through our Express Drive vehicle rental  program. In addition, we have established  environmental  programs, such as our commitment  to 100% EVs on ourplatform\n by the end of 2030. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset\n life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments\n may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a\n driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially\n suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness,\n which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,\n stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods,\n and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized\n over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.  Any  failure  to  increase  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  our  investments  and  otherexpenses\n could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks andchallenges as we encounter \nthem, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.As\n our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results ofoperations\n will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,increasing competit\nion, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our businessmodel\n and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incursignificant losses in the \nfuture and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We face intense competit\nion and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices\n and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greaterresources\n or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive positioncould weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or gro\nwth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.\nOur main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Cana\nda include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in bike and scooter sharing include Lime and Bird.Our\n main competitors in consumer vehicle rentals include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also compete withcertain non-rideshar\ning transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.Additionally,\n there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies, bike and scooter sharing companies, consumer vehicle rental companies, non-ridesharingtransportation\n network companies and traditional automotive manufacturers that may expand into the United States and Canada, such as BMW, which has an ongoingpresence in the transpor\ntation network market in Europe. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in thefuture,\n including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Aurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobilemanufacturers and suppli\ners. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.Certain\n of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, research and development, manufacturing and other resources,greater\n name recognition, longer operating histories or a larger user base than we do. They may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and saleof\n offerings and offer lower prices than we do, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, they may have greater resources to deploy towards theresearch, development\n and commercialization of new technologies, including autonomous vehicle technology or Light Vehicles, or they may have other financial, technicalor resource advantages. Thes\ne factors may allow our competitors or potential competitors to derive greater revenue and20\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
