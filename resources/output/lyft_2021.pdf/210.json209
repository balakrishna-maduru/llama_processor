The foregoing is a non-exhaustive list, and this release is intended to cover\nall claims that may be lawfully waived by agreement, including those not specifically listed. \nThe parties agree and acknowledge that the payments made pursuant to this Agreement are not related to sexual harassment.\n(b) \nCovenant Not to Sue. Besides waiving rights and releasing claims encompassed by the General Release in Section 7(a) above, Employee promises not to bring a lawsuit or arbitration against the Company alleging any claim or violation of rights covered by that General Release. This\nCovenant Not to Sue is different from the General Release in that it is an affirmative promise by Employee, violation of which can result in a claim\nfor damages by the Company against Employee. Details regarding exceptions to this covenant and damages Employee must pay for violating it are\ncontained in Sections 7(d) and 18 below.\n(c) \nWaiver of Unknown Claims. This general and complete release covers both claims that Employee knows about and those that Employee may not know about and that exist in Employee\u2019s favor at the time of executing this Agreement. Employee understands and for valuable\nconsideration hereby expressly agrees that in the event of any injury, loss, or damage sustained by Employee which is not now known or suspected,\nor in the event that the losses or damages now known or suspected have present or future consequences not now known or suspected, this Agreement\nshall nevertheless constitute a full and final release as to the Company, and that this Agreement shall apply to all such known or unsuspected injuries,\nlosses, damages or consequences.\nEmployee understands and for valuable consideration hereby expressly waives all of the rights and benefits of Section 1542 of the California\nCivil Code, which section reads as follows:\nA\n GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASINGPARTY\n DOES  NOT  KNOW  OR  SUSPECT  TO  EXIST  IN  HIS  OR  HER  FAVOR  AT  THE  TIME  OFEXECUTING\n THE  RELEASE  AND  THAT,  IF  KNOWN  BY  HIM  OR  HER,  WOULD  HAVEMATERIALLY\n AFFECTED  HIS  OR  HER  SETTLEMENT  WITH  THE  DEBTOR  OR  RELEASEDPARTY\n.Employee\n also  understands  and  agrees  that  this  is  a  \u201cnegotiated  severance  agreement\u201d  as  that  term  is  used  under  California  law  because  it  isvoluntary,\n deliberate, and informed, provides consideration of value to Employee, and Employee has been given notice and an opportunity to retainan attorney or is represented by an attorney.\n(d) \nMatters Not Waived. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan\nbenefits, claims to enforce this Agreement, claims under sections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes\nthat may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of this type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury\nor illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which Employee has not already filed a workers compensation claim. Nothing in any part of this\nAgreement limits or waives Employee\u2019s right to file a charge with an administrative agency, provide testimony or other information to an agency, or\ntake part in any agency investigation; however, Employee is waiving Employee\u2019s right to recover any monetary or other relief in connection with\nsuch an investigation or charge filed by Employee or by any other individual, or a charge filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nor any other federal, state or local agency. If Employee is awarded money damages as described in the previous sentence, Employee shall decline to\naccept any such monetary award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and the limitation on monetary recovery does not limit Employee\u2019s\nright to receive any statutory or otherwise authorized award for information provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Employee does\nnot waive any rights or claims that arise after the effective date of this Agreement.\n3\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
