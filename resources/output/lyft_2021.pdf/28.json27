Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.If\n we are unable to efficiently develop, enable, or implement partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platforms in a timelymanner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be advers\nely affected.We\n partner with several companies to develop autonomous vehicle technology and offerings. Autonomous driving is a new and evolving market, which makes itdifficult\n to  predict  its  acceptance,  its  growth,  and  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  necessary  investments  and  other  trends,  including  when  it  may  be  more  broadly  orcommercially\n available.  Our  initiatives  may  not  perform  as  expected,  which  would  reduce  the  return  on  our  investments  in  this  area  and  our  partners  may  decide  toterminate\n or  scale  back  their  partnerships  with  us.  In  addition,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  did,  and  may  in  the  future,  adversely  delay  or  prevent  us,  or  our  current  orprospective partners and supp\nliers, from being able to develop or deploy autonomous vehicle technology. Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, weno\n longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologyon\n our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if ourefforts\n to  optimize  our  strategy  with  regard  to  our  autonomous  vehicle  technology  development  are  not  successful,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adverse\nly affected.The\n autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our prospects,business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe\n have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous drivinginvolves\n a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied both on our own research anddevelopment\n and on strategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is noassurance\n that this research and development or these partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manneror\n at all and as a result of the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, we are more reliant on partnerships for this development. In order to gain acceptance, thereliability of autono\nmous vehicle technology must continue to advance.Additional challenges to th\ne development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:\u2022\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;\u2022\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;\u2022\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;\u2022\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy; and\u2022\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.There\n are  a  number  of  existing  laws,  regulations  and  standards  that  may  apply  to  autonomous  vehicle  technology,  including  vehicle  standards  that  were  notoriginally\n intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,conflicting\n or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the compliancecosts\n associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such acceptance, if atall, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our busine\nss strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market. Even if autonomous vehicle technologyis\n successfully developed and implemented, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent technology and its adopters. In particular, there could be negativepublic\n perception  surrounding  autonomous  vehicles,  including  the  overall  safety  and  the  potential  for  injuries  or  death  occurring  as  a  result  of  accidents  involvingautonomous\n vehicles  and  the  potential  loss  of  income  to  human  drivers  resulting  from  widespread  market  adoption  of  autonomous  vehicles.  Such  negative  publicperception\n may result from incidents on our platform, incidents on our partners\u2019 or competitors\u2019 platforms, or events around autonomous vehicles more generally. Any ofthe foregoing risks and chal\nlenges could adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.Claims\n from riders, drivers or third parties that are harmed, whether or not our platform is in use, could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition andresults of operations.\nWe\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, riders, drivers or third-parties that areattributed\n to us through our offerings. We may also be subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or forharm\n related to the actions of drivers, riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemicand related public hea\nlth measures issued by various jurisdictions, including travel bans, restrictions, social distancing guidance, and shelter-in-place28\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
