If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to thesecompetitive\n challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnationthat could adversely af\nfect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market includeLime\n and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces.We also compete with ce\nrtain non-ridesharing transportation network companies and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers.Additionally,\n there  are  other  non-U.S.-based  TaaS  network  companies,  non-ridesharing  transportation  network  companies  and  traditional  automotivemanufacturers that may expand into the United States and Cana\nda, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe. There arealso\n a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple,Aurora,\n Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challengesfrom current compet\nitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.We\n believe we can compete favorably. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longeroperating\n histories,  larger  marketing  budgets  and  established  marketing  relationships,  access  to  larger  customer  bases  and  significantly  greater  resources  for  thedevelopment\n of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related toOperational\n Factors\u2014We  face  intense  competition  and  could  lose  market  share  to  our  competitors,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  andresults of operations.\u201d\nSeasonality\nThe revenue we generate f\nrom our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. We expect thedemand\n for our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dryseasons.\n Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand. Although we have seensome\n signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recoveryremain\n uncertain. We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of suchmeasures,\n as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstandingusual seasonality.\nOur Brand and Marketing\nWe\n believe good energy moves the world. The Lyft brand is rooted in our hospitality principles: safety, simplicity, reliability, care, and delight. Our marketingefforts\n bring our brand to life across a variety of communication channels ranging from national broadcast campaigns to more direct communications like email and socialmedia engagement. We \nalso benefit from positive word of mouth in the existing Lyft rider communityOur\n marketing efforts educate people about Lyft products in creative and memorable ways and generate greater brand awareness among potential drivers andriders.\n Our brand marketing includes but is not limited to Lyft-produced content, culture and entertainment partnerships, marketing partnerships, sponsored local events,and outdoor advertisements.\nWe\n use specific channels and initiatives so we can measure the impact of our marketing spend. We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,display advertising,\n radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with current riders througha variety of initia\ntives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.Our Commitment to Safety\nA\n strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers andriders on our platform, and we \ntake significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding hig\nh quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerlyknown\n as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization.

Our SCC team focuseson driving results based on exper\nience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets resolved during first contact with a driver orrider, and\n Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders.
