This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreementterminates\n or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis; classarbitrations\n and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and I agree that thearbitrator's award will be final and bi\nnding on both parties.This Arbitrat\nion Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted.

Accordingly, neither Inor Lyft shall bring, nor shall t\nhe arbitrator preside over, any form  of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all parties agree inwriting\n otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither  I nor Lyft may seek, normay the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or \nthat affects other employees.Notwithstanding\n any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this sectionmay\n be  resolved  only  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  not  by  an  arbitrator.
