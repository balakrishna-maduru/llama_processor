Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluatethe\n markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of su\nch evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If\n we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.\nOur\n continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease\n utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.  To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided\n access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our plat\nform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or\n superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour\n requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof\n our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,during\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\n visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\n expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Thisincludes\n a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal \nwith Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe\n required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment\n model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risksrelating\n to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.\nIf\n drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria\n and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract driverscould\n fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to increase utilization by existing drivers, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changesin\n certain laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool ofqualified\n drivers, which may result in increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operationsor\n research and development efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected.Other\n factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles orinsurance, or concerns about\n the availability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of driverson\n our platform or utilization of our platform by drivers, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail toincrease utiliza\ntion of our platform by existing drivers or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining acompetitive price o\nf rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we fail to cost-effectively attract new riders, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing riders, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould be harmed.\nOur\n success depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract new riders, retain existing riders and increase utilization of our platform by current riders.Riders\n have a wide variety of options for transportation, including personal vehicles, rental cars, taxis, public transit and other ridesharing and bike and scooter sharingofferings.\n Rider  preferences  may  also  change  from  time  to  time.  To  expand  our  rider  base,  we  must  appeal  to  new  riders  who  have  historically  used  other  forms  oftransportation\n or other ridesharing or bike and scooter sharing platforms. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of ourofferings,\n which  in  turn  drives  new  rider  growth  and  rider  utilization.  However,  our  reputation,  brand  and  ability  to  build  trust  with  existing  and  new  riders  may  beadversely\n affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, our policies, including our pricing algorithms, drivers on our platform, or our competitors,even if factually in\ncorrect or based on isolated incidents.
