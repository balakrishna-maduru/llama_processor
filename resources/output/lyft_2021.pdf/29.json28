We may also be subject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, third parties havein\n the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, butwas\n not at the time of such injury. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency,protection\n of our reputation and to prevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we faceincreasing\n public scrutiny. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any riders, drivers or third parties could result in negativepublicity\n and  harm  to  our  brand,  reputation,  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  Our  insurance  policies  and  programs  may  not  provide  sufficientcoverage\n to adequately mitigate the potential liability we face, especially where any one incident, or a group of incidents, could cause disproportionate harm, and we mayhave to pay high premiums or dedu\nctibles for our coverage and, for certain situations, we may not be able to secure coverage at all.As\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles, we are subject to an increasing number of claims, lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings related toinjuries to, or deaths of, r\niders of our Light Vehicles, including potential indemnification claims. In some cases, we could be required to indemnify governmental entities forclaims arising out of issu\nes, including issues that may be outside of our control, such as the condition of the public right of way. Any such claims arising from the use of ourLight\n Vehicles, regardless of merit or outcome, could lead to negative publicity, harm to our reputation and brand, significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure ordecreased\n use of our Light Vehicles. Further, the bikes and scooters we design and contract to manufacture using third-party suppliers and manufacturers, including certainassets\n and components we design and have manufactured for us, have in the past contained and could in the future contain design or manufacturing product issues, whichcould\n also lead to injuries or death to riders. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all product issues, and failure to do so could harm ourreputation\n and brand or result in personal injury or products liability claims or regulatory proceedings. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \nresults of operations.Our\n bikes and scooters have experienced product issues from time to time, which has in the past resulted in, and, in the future may result in, product recalls andremoval\n from service, injuries, litigation, enforcement actions and regulatory proceedings, and could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition andresults of operations.\nWe\n design, contract to design and manufacture, and directly and indirectly modify, maintain and repair, bikes and scooters for our network of Light Vehicles.Such\n bikes and scooters have in the past contained, and, in the future may contain, product issues related to their design, materials or construction, may be improperlymaintained\n or repaired or may be subject to vandalism. These product issues, improper maintenance or repair or vandalism have in the past unexpectedly interfered, andcould\n in the future unexpectedly interfere, with the intended operations of the bikes or scooters, and have resulted, and could in the future result, in other safety concerns,including\n alleged injuries to riders or third parties. Although we, our contract manufacturers, and our third-party service providers test our bikes and scooters before theyare deployed onto our network, the\nre can be no assurance we will be able to detect or prevent all product issues.Failure\n to detect, prevent, fix or timely report real or perceived product issues and vandalism, or to properly maintain or repair our bikes and scooters has resultedor\n may  result  in  a  variety  of  consequences  including  product  recalls  and  removal  from  service,  service  interruptions,  alleged  injuries,  litigation,  enforcement  actions,including fines or penalt\nies, regulatory proceedings, and negative publicity. Even if injuries to riders or third parties are not the result of any product issues in, vandalism of,or the failure to prope\nrly maintain or repair our bikes or scooters, we may incur expenses to defend or settle any claims or respond to regulatory inquiries, and our brand andreputation\n may be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could also result in decreased usage of our network of Light Vehicles and adversely affect our business, brand,financial conditions and \nresults of operations.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Since 2012\n and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generally experienced rapid growth in our business, the number of users on our platform and our geographicreach, and we expect to cont\ninue to experience growth in the future following the recovery of the world economy from the pandemic. This growth placed, and may continueto\n place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Employee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquartersand in a number of our\n offices across the United States and internationally. The number of our full-time employees increased from 2,708 as of December 31, 2017, to 4,453as\n of December 31, 2021. However, from time to time, we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our business. For example, in thesecond\n quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resultingfrom\n the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our employees. Steps we take to manage ourbusiness operations, includin\ng remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely affect our reputation andbrand, our ability to rec\nruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.Our ability to manage\n our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business willrequire\n us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growthcould\n strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retainhighly skilled personnel and m\naintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the29\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
