In addition to fines, penalties forfailing\n to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions. We couldalso be required to make \nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.For\n various payment options, we are required to pay fees such as interchange and processing fees that are imposed by payment processors, payment networks andfinancial\n institutions.  These  fees  are  subject  to  increases,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  ourpayment processors requir\ne us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks and which include, amongother\n obligations, requirements to comply with security standards. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules inways\n that might prohibit us from providing certain offerings to some users, be costly to implement or difficult to follow, and if we fail or are alleged to fail to comply withapplicable\n rules or requirements of payment card networks, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose our ability to accept online payments orother\n payment card transactions. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or the users on ourplatform violate th\nese rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n rely on other third-party service providers and if such third parties do not perform adequately or terminate their relationships with us, our costs may increase andour business, financial condition and results of operations could be advers\nely affected.Our\n success  depends  in  part  on  our  relationships  with  other  third-party  service  providers.  For  example,  we  rely  on  third-party  encryption  and  authenticationtechnologies\n licensed from third parties that are designed to securely transmit personal information provided by drivers and riders on our platform. Further, from time totime,\n we enter into strategic commercial partnerships in connection with the development of new technology, the growth of our qualified driver base, the provision of newor\n enhanced offerings for users on our platform and our expansion into new markets. If any of our partners terminates its relationship with us, or refuses to renew itsagreement\n with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such providers inan\n acceptable time frame. We also rely on other software and services supplied by third parties, such as communications and internal software, and our business may beadversely\n affected to the extent such software and services do not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, are compromised or experience outages. Any ofthese\n risks could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any negative publicity related to any of ourthird-party\n partners, including any publicity related to quality standards or safety concerns, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead toincreased regulatory o\nr litigation exposure.We\n incorporate technology from third parties into our platform, products, and services. We cannot be certain that our licensors are not infringing the intellectualproperty\n rights  of  others  or  that  the  suppliers  and  licensors  have  sufficient  rights  to  the  technology  in  all  jurisdictions  in  which  we  may  operate.  Some  of  our  licenseagreements\n may be terminated by our licensors for convenience. If we are unable to obtain or maintain rights to any of this technology because of intellectual propertyinfringement\n claims brought by third parties against our suppliers and licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue to obtain the technology or enter into newagreements on commer\ncially reasonable terms, our ability to develop our platform or products containing that technology or provide services using that technology could beseverely limited and our business could be harmed. \nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain necessary technology from third parties, we may be forced to acquire or developalternate technology, which may\n require significant time and effort and may be of lower quality or performance standards. This would limit and delay our ability to providenew or competitive offerings and increase our costs. If\n alternate technology cannot be obtained or developed, we may not be able to offer certain functionality as part of ourofferings, which could adverse\nly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we\n are not able to successfully develop new offerings on our platform and enhance our existing offerings, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould be adversely affect\ned.Our\n ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders and increase utilization of our offerings will dependin\n part on our ability to successfully create and introduce new offerings and to improve upon and enhance our existing offerings. As a result, we may introduce significantchanges\n to our  existing  offerings  or develop  and  introduce  new and unproven offerings.  For example,  in April 2020,  we began piloting  a delivery  service  platform  inresponse\n to the COVID-19 pandemic. If these new or enhanced offerings are unsuccessful, including as a result of any inability to obtain and maintain required permits orauthorizations or other regulatory constraints or\n because they fail to generate sufficient return on our investments, our business, financial condition and results of operationscould\n be  adversely  affected.  Furthermore,  new  driver  or  rider  demands  regarding  service  or  platform  features,  the  availability  of  superior  competitive  offerings  or  adeterioration\n in the quality of our offerings or our ability to bring new or enhanced offerings to market quickly and efficiently could negatively affect the attractiveness ofour\n platform  and  the  economics  of  our  business  and  require  us  to  make  substantial  changes  to  and  additional  investments  in  our  offerings  or  our  business  model.  Inaddition,\n we  frequently  experiment  with  and  test  different  offerings  and  marketing  strategies.  If  these  experiments  and  tests  are  unsuccessful,  or  if  the  offerings  andstrategies\n we introduce based on the results of such experiments and tests do not perform as expected, our ability to attract new qualified drivers and new riders, retainexisting qualified drivers\n and existing riders and maintain or increase utilization of our offerings may be adversely affected.33\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
