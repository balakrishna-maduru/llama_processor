No  individual  securityincurred continuous unreal\nized losses for greater than 12 months.The\n Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordancewith\n its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of December 31, 2021, the credit-quality of the Company\u2019smarketable\n available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31,2021\n was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with COVID-19. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle thesecurities at\n a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less than their amortized costbasis.\n The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery oftheir\n amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its assessment of credit losses forany marketable available-for-sale\n debt security as of December 31, 2021. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and willbe\n recognized on the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.
