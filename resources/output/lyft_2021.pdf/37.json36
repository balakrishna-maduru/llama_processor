For example, in response to\n the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we took certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs,furloughs\n and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees. These actions may adverselyaffect\n our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  personnel  and  maintain  our  culture.  If  we  are  not  able  to  maintain  our  culture,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adverse\nly affected.We\n depend  on  our  key  personnel  and  other  highly  skilled  personnel,  and  if  we  fail  to  attract,  retain,  motivate  or  integrate  our  personnel,  our  business,  financialcondition and results of operations could be adversel\ny affected.Our success depends in part on the continued service of our founder\ns, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and onour\n ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be successful in attracting andretaining\n qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs and actions we take in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business may harm ourreputation\n or impact our ability to recruit qualified personnel in the future. For example, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we haveundertaken\n certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs, furloughs and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability toattract\n and retain employees. Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our management team, work for us on an at-will basis, and there is no assurance that anysuch\n employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may bedifficult\n for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly incritical areas o\nf our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.We\n face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled\n personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and may continue to intensify as the economy recovers from COVID-19. To attract and retain toptalent, we have\n had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel oftenconsider\n the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to providecompetitive\n compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition. Certainof\n our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and may continue to receivesignificant\n proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,  which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significantamounts\n of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and wemay\n never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meetforecasts and employee \nmorale, productivity and retention could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users and unfavorable changes in or our failure to comply withexisting or future laws governing the Internet and mobile de\nvices.Our\n business  depends  on  users\u2019  access  to  our  platform  via  a  mobile  device  and  the  Internet.  We  may  operate  in  jurisdictions  that  provide  limited  Internetconnectivity,\n particularly as we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device are frequently provided by companies with significant market powerthat\n could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of users\u2019 ability to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of ourplatform rely on in any pa\nrticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device accessibility, even fora short period of time, cou\nld adversely affect our results of operations.Moreover,\n we are subject to a number of laws and regulations specifically governing the Internet and mobile devices that are constantly evolving. Existing andfuture\n laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth and availability of the Internet and online offerings, require us to change our business practices orraise\n compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, privacy and data protection, informationsecurity,\n pricing,  copyrights,  distribution,  mobile  and  other  communications,  advertising  practices,  consumer  protections,  the  provision  of  online  payment  services,unencumbered Internet\n access to our offerings and the characteristics and quality of online offerings, among other things. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to complywith any of\n these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities orothers, which could adversely i\nmpact our results of operations.37\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
