Our  inability  to  adequately  detect  or  prevent  fraudulent  transactions  could  harm  our  reputation  or  brand,  result  in  litigation  orregulatory action and l\nead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\n have  also  incurred,  and  may  in  the  future  incur,  losses  from  fraud  and  other  misuse  of  our  platform  by  drivers  and  riders,  including  in  connection  withprograms\n we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand\n miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our pa\nrtner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\n we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\nfected.Shared and\n Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With\n a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider\u2019s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along\n a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\n level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With\n the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\nd to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\n take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless\n than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.  In  addition,  riders\u2019  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable  toeffectively\n account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  we  are  unable  toeffectively\n manage our up-front pricing methodology in conjunction with our existing and future pricing and incentive programs, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could b\ne adversely affected.Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harm\ned.We\n believe  that  our  company  culture,  which  promotes  authenticity,  empathy  and  support  for  others,  has  been  critical  to  our  success.  We  face  a  number  ofchallenges that may a\nffect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:\u2022\nfailure to identify, attract, reward and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and further our culture, values and mission;\u2022\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\u2022\nshelter-in-place orders in certain jurisdictions where we operate that have required many of our employees to work remotely, as well as permanent return to workarrangements and workplac\ne strategies;\u2022\nthe inability to achieve adherence to our internal policies and core values, including our diversity, equity and inclusion practices and initiatives;\u2022\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;\u2022\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry;\u2022\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;36\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
