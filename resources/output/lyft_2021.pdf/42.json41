We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative\n actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California\u2019s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including\n those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors.\n We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. See thesection titled \u201cLega\nl Proceedings\u201d for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.Claims by others that we infringed their proprietar\ny technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies\n in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights.\n In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.\n As we gain an increasingly  high public  profile  and the number  of competitors  in our market  increases  and as we continue to develop new technologies  andintellectual\n property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our mark\nets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From timeto time third parties may\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional\n information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and,\n in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful\n in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\n portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\n rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour\n management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection\n with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantialdamages,\n royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing\n or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan\ncial condition and results of operations.With\n respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot\n be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and thereforeour\n competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all,we may\n be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which we would be unableto\n continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\nations.Failure to protect or enforce our intell\nectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\n success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms ofinformation,\n knowhow and technology), or intellectual property, and as we grow, we will continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing orfuture\n business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and contractual  restrictions  to establish andprotect\n our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if wedo\n detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming andexpensive and\n could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and otherunauthorized\n third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services,which\n could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry. Some license provisions that protect against unauthorized use, copying,transfer and disclosure o\nf our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and42\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
