Net loss decreased $743.5 million, or 42%, from$1.8\n billion in 2020 to $1.0 billion in 2021, which included a benefit from a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million from the transaction with Woven Planet. Adjusted EBITDA in2021\n was  $92.9  million,  marking  our  first  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  profitability.  We  remain  focused  on  our  long-term  growth  opportunities.  With  $2.3  billion  inunrestricted\n cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to continue business operations and totake\n action we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, stockholders, stakeholders and of drivers and riders on the Lyft Platform.

We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 mill\nion paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\n divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued\n operation.

Though  we  experienced  arecovery in\n revenue per Active Rider and the number of Active Riders in 2021, the number of Active Rider levels have not reached levels we experienced prior to the onsetof\n the pandemic in March 2020. The number of Active Riders is a key indicator of the scale of our community and awareness of our brand.
