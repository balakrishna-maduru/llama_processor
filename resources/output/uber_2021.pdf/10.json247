In  addition,governmental\n agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significantfines\n or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations onour contractual rel\nationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.Intellectual Property\nWe\n believe  that  our  intellectual  property  is  essential  to  our  business  and  affords  us  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  markets  in  which  we  operate.  Ourintellectual\n property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,registered and unregist\nered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To\n protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions.\n Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate.\n We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our propri\netary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and Development\nBecause\n the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability\n to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.  We  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existingofferings\n and  services,  and  to  expand  the  range  of  our  offerings  through  research  and  development  (\u201cR&D\u201d)  and  acquisition  of  third-party  businesses  andtechnology.\nSeasonality\nMobility\nWe typically generate higher\n revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typicallygenerate\n lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America andEurope. We have typically \nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19\n pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pande\nmic continues.Delivery\nWe\n typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical\n growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which acc\nelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe\n are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately\n 72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.  Our  human  capital  strategies  are  developed  and  managed  by  our  Chief  PeopleOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and ar\ne overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject\n to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Adapting\n to  a  New  Way  of  Working.  In  2021,  the  ever-evolving  COVID-19  pandemic  continued  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  employees  and  ourworkforce management st\nrategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work. As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able todo\n so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans\u2014althoughmany\n of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced newdynamics\n into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stressand\n social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  The  issues  of  stress  and  balance  were  particularly  exacerbated  among  caregivers  of  youngchildren.\n To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigatedthis crisis in their pe\nrsonal and professional lives.
