In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa\n payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\n merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\n Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\n payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\n prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\n by those users. A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely a\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.\n As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\nions.In\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\n online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.\n Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\n other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\n payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand\n sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government\n authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or\n controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\nWe\n currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o\nf which could harm our business.We\n are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,\n including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle\n claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued aproposed\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the \ntotal payment to $9.1538\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
