If our operations in largemetropolitan\n areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adverselyimpacted.\nIn\n 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingd\nom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand\n consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible\n to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases\n or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term o\nr long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor\n pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or\n regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than\n would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour\n ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting\n licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan\n area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\nIn\n addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe\n number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment \nformula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers\n on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance\n in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips\n in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or\n may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices\n on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller\n and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban\n and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be \nlimited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021,\n we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating\n results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.\n In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom\n airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility\n and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating\n that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing\n operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite\n permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or\n Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.\n In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees,\n the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave\n entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries,\n we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airpor\nts in all jurisdictions.If\n we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those\n offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be ad\nversely impacted.We\n have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.\n For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the\n combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesh\naring24\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
