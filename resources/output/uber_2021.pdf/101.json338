The  guideline  public  company  approach  relies  on  publicly  available  market  data  of  comparable  companies  and  usescomparative\n valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarilyconsists of short-term r\nevenue projections.Once\n the  fair  value  of  the  investee  is  estimated,  an  option-pricing  model  (\u201cOPM\u201d),  a  common  stock  equivalent  (\u201cCSE\u201d)  method  or  a  hybrid  approach  isemployed\n to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around theinvestees\u2019 expected time to li\nquidity and volatility.An\n increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, couldresult\n in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, andvolatility\n are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In thefuture, depending on the weight of \nevidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.We determine rea\nlized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.Didi Investment\nOn June 30, 2021, Didi started trading on the New York Stock Ex\nchange. Accordingly, our investment in preferred shares of Didi, which was previouslyaccounted for under the\n measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, was converted to ordinary shares with a readily determinable fair value and thereforechanged to an investment m\neasured at fair value on a recurring basis.
