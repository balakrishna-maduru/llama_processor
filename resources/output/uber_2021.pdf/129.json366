As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we\n had  recorded  aggregate  liabilities  of  $1.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.3  billion  and  $1.3  billion  relate  to  non-income  tax  matters,respectively,\n in  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  all  of  our  legal,  regulatory  and  non-income  tax  matters  that  wereprobable and reasonably est\nimable.We\n are  currently  party  to  various  legal  and  regulatory  matters  that  have  arisen  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  include,  among  others,  allegedindependent\n contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims,unfair\n competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act(\u201cTCPA\u201d)\n claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, andother\n matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit\n proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia\n State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification\n claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange\n of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results ofoperations,\n or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere\n resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of  management's  expectations,  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be  materiallyadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn\n January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d\n test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming\n services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity\u2019s\n control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed fo\nr the hiring entity.On\n May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan\n Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive\n advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the\n Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Co\nurt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court o\nf Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition\n 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers \nare able to maintain their status as independent contractors127\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
