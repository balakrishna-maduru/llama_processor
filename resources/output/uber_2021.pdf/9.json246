For example:\u2022\nIn London, Transport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November2019,\n TfL  declined  to  issue  us  a  license,  finding  that  we  were  not  \u201cfit  and  proper,\u201d  including  with  respect  to  confidence  in  our  change  and  releasemanagement\n processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same condi\ntions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\u2022\nSince April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements,\n including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing\n requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices.\n Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on\n our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\n\u2022\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be pi\ncked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon\n the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime\n and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on\n our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour\n platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement\n minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislativeor regulatory initia\ntives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See\n the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significantcomplexities for our busin\ness and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we \nmay be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and Protection\nOur\n technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  ourcompliance\n with  laws  dealing  with  the  collection  and  processing  of  personal  data  is  core  to  our  strategy  to  improve  platform  user  experience  and  build  trust.Regulators\n around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing ofpersonally\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the Europea\nn Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a lawwhich went into effect in\n May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer\n Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor\n covered  businesses.  U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  ofpersonally\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November2020 (effective in Janua\nry 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial Services\nMost\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments\n B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the\u201cEEA\u201d).\n Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses\n to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such lawscould\n affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdi\nctions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.Antitrust\nCompetition\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are do\ning so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
