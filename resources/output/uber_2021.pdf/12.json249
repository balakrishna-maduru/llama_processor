A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\nent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\ned work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\nes. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\n compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\n\u2022\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould\n be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp\n based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefi\nts doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis\n change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also annou\nnced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers \nand to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022\nProtections and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition\nal protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher\ne and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022\nProgression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree\n programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their fami\nly members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\u2022\nEngagement:  We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe thatthe\n best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Driversto participate\n in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveysto gather feedback on our app, ou\nr support services, and other matters.For\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers, whether\n as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adverselyimpacted.\u201d\n included  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  as  well  our  2021  ESG  Report  and  our  2021  People  and  Culture  Report.
