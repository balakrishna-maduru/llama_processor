Goodwill  is  primarily  attributed  to  the  assembled  workforce  of  Postmates  and  anticipated  operational  synergies.  Goodwill  wasassigned\n to  our  Delivery  segment.  The  fair  values  assigned  to  tangible  and  identifiable  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  are  based  onmanagement\u2019s estim\nates and assumptions at the time of acquisition.The\n following  table  sets  forth  the  components  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  acquired  and  their  estimated  useful  lives  as  of  the  date  of  acquisition  (inmillions, except years):\nFair Value\nWeighted Average RemainingUseful Life - Years\nMerchant relationship\n$ 260 7 Fleet relationship\n110 1.5 Consumer relationship\n280 5 Developed technology\n280 2 Trade names\n30 3 IPR&D\n55 N/A Total\n$ 1,015 Consumer,\n merchant and fleet relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with merchants (such as restaurants), Postmates end-users,and\n Postmates couriers (referred to as \u201cfleet\u201d). Developed technology represents the fair value of Postmates\u2019 technology. Trade names relate to the \u201cPostmates\u201dtrade name, trademarks, and\n domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is four years.Tangible net assets were va\nlued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as these amounts approximate their fair values.The\n results  of  Postmates  were  included  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  from  the  date  of  acquisition,  December  1,  2020.  For  the  period  fromDecember 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Post\nmates contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.During\n the fourth quarter of 2021, we finalized our estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed for Postmates.As\n a result, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded measurement period adjustments of $181 million net, to accrued and other current liabilitiesand deferred tax liab\nility, with a corresponding increase to goodwill.Routematch\nOn July 14, 2020 (the \u201cRoutematch Acquisiti\non Date\u201d), we acquired 100% of the equity of Routematch, a software company offering specialized software andsolutions\n to transit agencies, serving customers in the United States and Australia.
