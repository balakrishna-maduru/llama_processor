We  have  investigated  many  of  these  matters  and  we  areimplementing a\n number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. Inmany cases,\n we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly toinvestigate\n and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business,reputation, financia\nl condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.Indemnifications\nIn\n the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,we\n may  be  obligated  to  indemnify  such  parties  for  losses  or  claims  suffered  or  incurred  in  connection  with  their  activities  or  non-compliance  with  certainrepresentations\n and  warranties  made  by  us.  In  addition,  we  have  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  our  officers,  directors,  and  certain  current  andformer\n employees,  and  our  certificate  of  incorporation  and  bylaws  contain  certain  indemnification  obligations.  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  maximumpotential loss under these \nindemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities\nVIEs are legal entities that\n lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.Consolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we ha\nve the power to directthe\n activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidatedVIEs.\nTotal\n assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $1.2 billion and $3.9 billion,respectively.\n Total  liabilities  included  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  these  VIEs  as  of  December  31,  2020  were  not  material  and  $1.0  billion  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.\nFreight Holding\nIn\n July  2018, we  created  a  new  majority-owned  subsidiary,  Uber  Freight  Holding  Corporation  (\u201cFreight  Holding\u201d).  The  purpose  of  Freight  Holding  is  toperform the business act\nivities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was determined to be a variable interest.In\n October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (\u201c2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d)with outside investor (\u201c2020 Freigh\nt Series A Investor\u201d) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock (\u201cFreight Series A\u201d).In July 2021, we entered into a\n Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The Public Investment Fund, whichis an investor in Uber.\nIn November 2021, Freight Holdin\ng entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (\u201c2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement\u201d) with outsideinvestors\n (\u201cFreight Series A-1 Investors\u201d) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight Holding (\u201cFreight Series A-1\u201d). Neither the FreightSeries A\n or Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that Freight Holding is a consolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we continue toown\n the  majority  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Freight  Holding  and  report  non-controlling  interest  as  further  described  in  Note  17  \u2013  Non-Controlling Interests.\nDivestiture of ATG Business and Aurora Investments\nIn\n April 2019, we contributed certain of our subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities related to our autonomous vehicle technologies (excluding liabilitiesarising from\n certain indemnification obligations related to the Levandowski arbitration and any remediation costs associated with certain obligations that may ariseas a\n result of the Waymo settlement) to Apparate in exchange for common units representing 100% ownership interest in Apparate.
