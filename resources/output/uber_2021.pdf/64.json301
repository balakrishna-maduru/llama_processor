Accordingly, we believe that AdjustedEBITDA\n provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management teamand\n board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cashexpenses and certain variable charges. To\n help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excludingthe\n impacts  of  COVID-19  response  initiatives  related  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Drivers  personally  impacted  by  COVID-19,  the  cost  of  personalprotective\n equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides andfood\n deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find theexclusion\n of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact ofthese response initiat\nives on our results of operations.COVID-19 Response Initiatives\nTo\n support  those  whose  earning  opportunities  have  been  depressed  as  a  result  of  COVID-19, as  well  as  communities  hit  hard  by  the  pandemic,  we  haveannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payment\ns for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost ofpersonal\n protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to freerides\n and  food  deliveries  to  healthcare  workers,  seniors,  and  others  in  need  as  well  as  charitable  donations.  The  payments  for  financial  assistance  to  Driverspersonally\n impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.The cost of personal protec\ntive equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in needas well as charitable don\nations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjust\ned EBITDA ReconciliationAdjusted\n EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the relatedfinancial informa\ntion prepared in accordance with GAAP.
