This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\ness.In\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Furt\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our cr\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\nr credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\n our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard\n (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\n operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment cardnetwork\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating\n rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations\n of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives\n from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.  The  loss  of  our  credit  card  acceptance  privileges  for  any  one  of  thesereasons, or\n the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,and operating results.\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spa\nmming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.We\n rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms andmobile\n payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the informationtechnology systems of our\n third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,including\n sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,viruses,\n spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreatsare\n constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticatedcyberattacker, such as\n a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security ofour\n systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitiveposition,\n result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adverselyaffect our reputat\nion, business and operating results.Various other\n factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,issues\n with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, orbreaches\n in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gainaccess\n to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effectivemanner, they could result \nin adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results.
