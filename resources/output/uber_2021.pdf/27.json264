We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles\n present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\n on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies \ninvolve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies\n that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor\n us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.\nFederal\n and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations\n could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we\n may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existin\ng or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substant\nial fines or penalties.Our\n business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.\nOur\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are\n often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\n turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for \nthe planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In\n addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered\n into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our businessdifferently than me\nmbers of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,operations, or business plans. We \nmay not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.In addition, our failure \nto put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transitioninto new\n roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operatingresults.\n The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personneltransitions\n has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, andyears\n of industry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future businessprospects could be adversely \naffected.To\n attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnelwe require to operate our bus\niness effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,25\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
