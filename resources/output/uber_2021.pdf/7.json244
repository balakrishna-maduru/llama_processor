Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand\n accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricingand the ability to book a shipm\nent with the touch of a button.We\n serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,secure\n capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors representsignificant efficiency improvement\ns over traditional freight brokerage providers.During\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough\n Transplace\u2019s  expertise  in transportation  management.  The acquisition  of Transplace  has been accounted  for as a business combination.  For additionalinformation, see Note\n 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlatform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe\n foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\ncities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\nWe intend to continue to inv\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\n attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\n compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities\n as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers. We exited\n 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our\u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our mul\ntiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.We\n are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlockingcross-platform adver\ntising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment\nWe\n compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe\n logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants \ngiven the low barriers to entry that characterize5\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
