BUSINESS\nOverview\nUber\n Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\n platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).  We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice\n providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  \u201cend-user(s)\u201d  or\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\nagmented markets.Mobility\nMobility\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\nOur\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\nDuring\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup,\n Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. Theacquisition\n of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, \u201cFinancial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Freight\nWe believe that Freigh\nt is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries\n to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis\n highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of theprocess\n conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally\n difficult  for carriers  to find and book the shipments  that work for their businesses,  spending hours on the phone negotiating  pricing  and terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv\nersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,4\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
