Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16,2020.\nThe\n California  Supreme  Court  declined  the  petition  for  review  on  February  10,  2021.  The  lawsuit  was  returned  to  the  trial  court  following  the  appellateproceedings on February 22, 20\n21. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction withthe\n trial  court.  On April 16, 2021, the trial  court  signed an order  granting the stipulation.  Although the preliminary  injunction  has been dissolved, the lawsuitremains\n ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matterpending\n coordination  with  other  California  employment  related  matters,  which  was  granted  and  a  coordination  judge  was  assigned.  We  intend  to  continue  tovigorously defend ourselves. Our chan\nces of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.In\n addition,  in  January  2021,  a  petition  was  filed  with  the  California  Supreme  Court  by  several  drivers  and  a  labor  union  alleging  that  Proposition  22  isunconstitutional,\n which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, theAlameda\n County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision withthe California Court of Appeal, \nand the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization has also filed an appeal.Massachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney Gene\nral filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Driversare\n employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss thecomplaint\n on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion inwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motio\nn to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success onthe merits are sti\nll uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.Swiss Social Security Reclassi\nficationSeveral\n Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or ofUber\n B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, aruling\n was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V.\n are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 asdependent\n workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno\n impact on our current operations. The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for thismatter is recorded within accr\nued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\nOn\n October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting thatthey\n should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. Thetribunal ruled\n on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment ofthe\n App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in Ju\nly 2020.On\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay \nincluding holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.On\n March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber.\n They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed asettlement\n process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register fora\n settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  have  extended  offers  to  all  drivers  eligible  forsettlement\n who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take placein\n 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, andholiday pay.\nOn\n June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed theenrollment\n of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for thesematters within accru\ned and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021.128\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
