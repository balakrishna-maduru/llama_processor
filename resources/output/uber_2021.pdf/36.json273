As  exchange  rates  vary,  revenue,  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  ofdepreciation\n and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affectour\n overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activitymay not\n completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we havelimited\n experience  establishing  hedging  programs,  which  could  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  operatingresults.\nIf\n we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesseswe acquire may not perform as expected or b\ne effectively integrated.As\n part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divestportions or aspects of our business, s\nell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including ourYandex.Taxi\n joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,Drizly and\n Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify atarget\n for  acquisition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  acquisition  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  receive  approval  from  theapplicable competi\ntion authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.Further,\n negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We\n may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable\n cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.  In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities,\n which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluateand\n execute  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  successfully  or  fail  to  successfully  address  any  of  these  risks,  our  business,  financial  condition,  andoperating results may be h\narmed.In\n addition,  any  businesses  we  acquire  may  not  perform  as  well  as  we  expect.  Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies,\n including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion\n prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policiesregarding\n data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, anddoing\n so  may  cause  our  relationships  with  government  authorities  in  certain  jurisdictions  to  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessingsignificant\n fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquiredcompany, business, or technology or a\ncquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\u2022\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\u2022\ndisrupting our ongoing business operat ions;\u2022\nplatform user accep tance of the acquired company\u2019s offerings;\u2022\nimplementing or rem ediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\u2022\nintegrating the acqui red business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\u2022\nretaining  and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing culturaldifferences\n between  acquired  businesses  and  our  business,  as  well  as  managing  costs  associated  with  eliminating  redundancies  or  transferringemployees on acceptabl\ne terms with minimal business disruption;\u2022\nmaintaining importan t business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\u2022\nintegrating the brand id entity of an acquired company with our own;\u2022\nintegrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\u2022\nliability for pre- acquisition activities of the acquired company;\u2022\nlitigation or other c laims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\u2022\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.We have in the past and may \nin the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company\u2019s operating functions. For example,with respect to the integ\nration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and34\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
