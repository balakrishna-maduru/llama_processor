The  redomiciliation  resulted  in  a  step-up  in  the  tax  basis  of  intellectual  property  rights  and  a  correlated  increase  in  foreigndeferred\n tax assets in an amount of $6.4 billion, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion (refer to the 2019 rate impact for \u201cChange inunrecognized\n tax benefits\u201d). Based on available objective evidence, management believed it was not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreigndeferred\n tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, were offset by a full valuation allowance (refer to the 2019 rate impact for\u201cValuation\n allowance\u201d) to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain  tax positions. The corresponding  deferred  tax asset and valuation  allowancebalance were included in \nthe \u201cFixed assets and intangible assets\u201d and \u201cValuation allowance\u201d lines, respectively, in the table below.In\n the  second  quarter  of  2020,  we  transferred  certain  intangible  assets  among  our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  to  align  our  structure  to  our  evolvingoperations.\n The  transaction  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  deferred  tax  assets  of  $354  million;  however,  there  was  no  financial  statement  benefitrecognized since the de\nferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.To\n align our structure to our evolving operations, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangibleassets. These intercompa\nny transfers did not have a material impact to the financial statements.(1)(2)\n(1)\n(2) \n121\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
