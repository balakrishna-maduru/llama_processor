Suchactions\n may  result  in  injuries,  property  damage,  or  loss  of  life  for  consumers  and  third  parties,  or  business  interruption,  brand  and  reputational  damage,  orsignificant\n liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers throughthird-party\n service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certainjurisdictions\n according  to  national  and  local  laws,  and  our  third-party  service  providers  may  fail  to  conduct  such  background  checks  adequately  or  discloseinformation\n that  could  be  relevant  to  a  determination  of  eligibility.  Further,  the  qualification  and  background  check  standards  for  Couriers  are  generally  lessextensive\n than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers\u2019 driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue toreceive\n complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civillitigation\n alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety ofour platform.\nIf Drivers or\n carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform asa conduit for criminal activity, consumers and shippers may not con\nsider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result ofour\n business relationship with such Driver or carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents andallegations\n worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwiseengaging\n in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing\n our platform,  Drivers  and merchants  may be unwilling  to continue using our platform.  In addition,  certain  regions  where we operate  have high rates  ofviolent\n crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers\n and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother\n criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and finan\ncial results could be adversely affected.Public\n reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or thi\nrd parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,\n we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers,\n or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay\n face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the\n growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers\n and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven\n roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need\n to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours,all of which heighten the potential risk\n of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare\n exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating\n costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and de\nfending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may\n increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expec\nted benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologie\ns, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools,\n features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including\n Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an\n on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources\n to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our developmentbudget\n efficiently  or  effectively  on  commercially  successful  and  innovative  technologies,  we  may  not  realize  the  expected  benefits  of  our  strategy.  Our  newinitiatives\n also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or noprior development or oper\nating experience.
