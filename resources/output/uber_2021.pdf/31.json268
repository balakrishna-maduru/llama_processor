Although we havedeveloped,\n and continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirableactivities\n on  our  platform,  and  security  breaches,  we  cannot  guarantee  that  such  measures  will  provide  absolute  security.  Our  efforts  on  this  front  may  beunsuccessful\n as  a  result  of,  for  example,  software  bugs  or  other  technical  malfunctions;  employee,  contractor,  or  vendor  error  or  malfeasance;  governmentsurveillance;\n or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure tomaintain\n the performance,  reliability,  security,  and availability  of  our products,  offerings,  and technical  infrastructure  to the satisfaction  of  platform  users andcertain\n regulators would likely harm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business,and our decreased abili\nty to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors \ncould adversely affect our business.Our\n platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependentupon our\n ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in thefuture\n contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in oursoftware,\n third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactionsbetween\n systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact theavailability of\n our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future thatcould\n result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control,such\n as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platformusers\n may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, ourrelease\n of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Anyerrors,\n bugs,  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  systems  after  release  could  result  in  an  interruption  in  the  availability  of  our  platform  or  a  negativeexperience\n for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to ourreputation,\n loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness\n and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks.AI\n algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial datapractices by us or others cou\nld impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine thedecisions,\n predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, andbrand or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to climate \nchange risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adverselyimpacted.\nWe\n face  climate  change  related  physical  and  transition  risks,  which  include  the  risk  of  market  shifts  toward  electric  vehicles  (\u201cEVs\u201d)  and  lower  carbonbusiness\n models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and durationof\n extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-partysuppliers,\n and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs tomaintain\n or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% ofvehicle\n miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Driversmay be\n subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adoptedin\n London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent weexperience Driver supply cons\ntraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.We\n have  made  climate  related  commitments  that  require  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time  and  circumstances  may  arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revis\ne the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.We\n have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to netzero\n climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct setsenvironmental\n standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towardsour\n climate  commitments  requires  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time,  and  circumstances  may  arise,  including  those  beyond  ourcontrol,\n that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability todedicate\n resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments isdependent on external fa\nctors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related29\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
