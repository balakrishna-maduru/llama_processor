Refer to Note 14 - Segment Information andGeographic Information fo\nr further information.Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe\n performed an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and determined that goodwill was notimpaired.\nDuring\n the first quarter of 2020, prior to the JUMP Divestiture in May 2020, market, macroeconomic and business conditions resulting from the COVID-19pandemic\n indicated  that  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  carrying  value  of  our  New  Mobility  reporting  unit  within  our  previous  Other  Bets  segment(subsequently renamed All Other after the JUMP Dive\nstiture), exceeded its fair value. As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparingthe\n fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companiesthat\n have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, agoodwill impairment charge\n of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration ofimpairments\n of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit. Also, during the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges to intangible assets of$23\n million, property and equipment of $47 million and other current assets of $23 million in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement ofoperations in our New Mobility repo\nrting unit.During the year ended Decembe\nr 31, 2021, we recognized an immaterial goodwill impairment charge.Intangible Assets\nThe components of intangible \nassets, net as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were as follows (in millions except years):Gross Carrying Value\nAccumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Weighted Average RemainingUseful Life - Years\nDecember 31, 2020\nConsumer, Merchant and other r\nelationships$ 1,007 $ (81) $ 926 8 Developed technology \n529 (69) 460 2 Trade names and trademarks\n183 (16) 167 7 Patents\n15 (6) 9 8 Other\n5 (3) 2 0 Intangible assets\n$ 1,739 $ (175) $ 1,564 (1)(2)\n(1) \n(2) \n(1)\n109\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
