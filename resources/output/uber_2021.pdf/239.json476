Not earlier than 60 days prior to, nor later than 10 Business Days prior to, the MaturityDate, the Borrower may, upon written notice (the \u201c\nExtension Notice \u201d) to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), request an extension of the Maturity Date for up to one year; \nprovided  that no more than two such extensions may be requested pursuant to this \nSection 2.19 .
