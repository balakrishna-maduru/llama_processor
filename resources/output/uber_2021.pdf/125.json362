Based on the analysis, we do not antic\nipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.The following table refl\nects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):Year Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020 2021 Unrecognized tax benefits \nat beginning of year$ 394 $ 1,797 $ 2,293 Gross increases - current y\near tax positions1,566 353 239 Gross increases - prior yea\nr tax positions16 191 134 Gross decreases - prior yea\nr tax positions(36) (48) (9) Gross decreases - settle\nments with tax authorities(143) \u2014 \u2014 Unrecognized tax benefits \nat end of year$ 1,797 $ 2,293 $ 2,657 As\n of December 31, 2021, approximately $204 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $2.5billion of the unrecogniz\ned tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  within  the  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  consolidated  statements  ofoperations. The amount of int\nerest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 was $12 million and $18 million, respectively.Although\n the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefitscould\n significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we areunable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognize\nd tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as ofDecember 31, 2021 that are r\neasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.We\n are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
