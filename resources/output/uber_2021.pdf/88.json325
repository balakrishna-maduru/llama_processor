Our marketable equity securities inpublicly\n traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investmentsin\n non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions\n for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable\n equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable\n equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue\n on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment\n at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  animpairment\n exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment. We include \ninvestments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt Securities\nAccounting\n for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.\n Investments in debt securities are  classified as available-for-sale and are  initially recorded at  fair  value. Investments in marketable debt securitiesinclude\n commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities\n with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale\n debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earn\nings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As\n of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone\n year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale de\nbt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-\nfor-sale Debt SecuritiesWe\n account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (\u201cASC  326\u201d).  Weadopted\n ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.  Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities\n at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstanceswhere\n we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized\n cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security\u2019s  amortized  cost.  Incircumstances\n where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether acredit\n loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings\n actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows\n of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value\n and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net\n income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements inexpected cash flows due to imp\nrovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nInvestments\n in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial\n interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted forunder\n the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to theinvestment\n balance, our proportionate share of the investees\u2019 net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results ofequity\n method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. Weevaluate\n each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value of th\ne investment may not be fully recoverable.
