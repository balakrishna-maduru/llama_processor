Personnel  costs  are  classified  based  on  each  employee\u2019s  classification,  lease  costs  (includingimpairments of right-of-use\n assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease\u2019s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-livedassets are recorded with\nin general and administrative expenses.Foreign Currency\nThe\n functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries\u2019 activities. Monetary assetsand\n liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate ineffect\n at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement arerecorded\n in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilitieswith\n non-U.S.  dollar  functional  currencies  are  translated  at  the  month-end  rate,  retained  earnings  and  other  equity  items  are  translated  at  historical  rates,  andrevenues\n and  expenses  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates  during  the  year.  Cumulative  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  within  accumulated  othercomprehensive income (los\ns), a separate component of total equity (deficit).Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe\n compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available tocommon stockholders\n for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as ifall income for the pe\nriod had been distributed.Our restricted common stock, and\n common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stockand\n any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitabledividend rights in the event \na cash dividend is declared on common stock.Prior\n to  conversion  to  common  stock  upon  our  IPO,  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would  have  been  entitled  to  dividends  inpreference\n to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restrictedcommon\n stock,  common  stock  issued  upon  early  exercise  of  stock  options,  and  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  on  a  pro-rata  basisassuming\n conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders ofsuch shares to participa\nte in our losses.Insurance Reserves\nWe\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance  mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential\n liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation.\n The  insurance  reserves  is  the  liability  for  unpaid  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses,  which  represents  the  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaidobligation\n for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of thebalance\n sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. Inaddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial\n judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends,severity\n trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.Adjustments, if\n any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settledwithin\n one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balancesheets.\nWhile\n management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. Allestimates\n of  ultimate  losses  and  allocated  loss  adjustment  expenses,  and  of  resulting  reserves,  are  subject  to  inherent  variability  caused  by  the  nature  of  theinsurance\n claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend upon\n the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from theestimate provided on the \nconsolidated balance sheets.Loss Contingencies\nWe\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\n course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.94\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
