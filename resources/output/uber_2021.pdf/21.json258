Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally.\n Although we have since made changes in our company\u2019s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote\n transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospe\ncts.Our historical\n workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies\n in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay\n not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged\n to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not b\ne successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and\n operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare\n unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely af\nfected.Since\n our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas\n placed,  and  will  continue  to  place,  significant  strain  on  our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal\n financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affectour operating results.\nAs\n our  operations  have  expanded,  we  have  grown  from  159  employees  as  of  December  31,  2012  to  approximately  29,300  global  employees  as  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Pr\noperly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including\n engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires\n perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and\n staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce\n and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin\n workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the\n distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor\n us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.  Properlymanaging\n our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so couldlikewise harm our business.\nOur\n failure  to  upgrade  our  technology  or  network  infrastructure  effectively  to  support  our  growth  could  result  in  unanticipated  system  disruptions,  slowresponse times,\n or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improvethe\n technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controlsover\n financial  reporting,  we  will  be  required  to  commit  substantial  financial,  operational,  and  technical  resources.  In  particular,  we  will  need  to  improve  ourtransaction\n processing  and  reporting,  operational,  and  financial  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  For  example,  due  to  our  significant  growth,  especially  withrespect to\n our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks\n of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our currentand\n planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hireadditional\n qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, orcarriers,\n platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affectour business, financial condi\ntion, and operating results.Our organizational structure is\n complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, productsand\n offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well asour\n reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and maturein\n these  areas.  If  we  are  unable  to  effectively  manage  the  growth  of  our  business,  the  quality  of  our  platform  may  suffer,  and  we  may  be  unable  to  addresscompetitive chall\nenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.19\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
