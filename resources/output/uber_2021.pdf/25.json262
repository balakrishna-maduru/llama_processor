These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors,\n some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For\n Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically\n generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We\n have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult\n of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue\n in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations;\n however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery\n in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto\n detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal\n trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of\n factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand\n our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith\n technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation,\n and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense\n levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expensesand\n investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations.\n If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of theirinvestment.\nIf\n our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial resultsand future prospects.\nOur\n Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that theywill continue to slow in the future.\n We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic andour ability to:\n\u2022\ngrow supply and demand on our platform; \u2022\nincrease existing pla tform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\u2022\ncontinue to introduce our pl atform to new markets;\u2022\nprovide high-quality support to Dr ivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers;\u2022\nexpand our business and increase ou r market share and category position;\u2022\ncompete with the products and o fferings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\u2022\ndevelop new products, offerings, and technologies;\u2022\nidentify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\u2022\npenetrate suburban and rur al areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\u2022\nreduce  the costs of our Mobility  offering  to better  compete  with personal vehicle  ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives  like publictransportation, which in many \ncases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\u2022\nmaintain existing loc al regulations in key markets where we operate;\u2022\nenter  or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022\nincrease positive per ception of our brand.We\n may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemmingfrom\n continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrierdemand,\n whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees invarious\n jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adverselyimpacted.\n We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will notachieve profitability.\n23\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
