The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield,which\n was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during eachperiod to reflect th\ne yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.Upon\n closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare\n subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments\n in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe\n changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equi\nty securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments\n in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requiresjudgment\n due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair\n value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the\n investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur\nities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We\n assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities\n includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity\n investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated\n statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized\n cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference\n between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof\n the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered\n in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof\n the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe\n present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related\n impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet\n with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome\n (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc\ne for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\nWe\n account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not\n a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, werecognize\n through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities\u2019 netincome or\n loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities\u2019 net income or loss one quarter inarrears.\n Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings.\nWe\n review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  theinvestment\n may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  andoperating trends of the inv\nestees, implied values in transactions of the investee\u2019s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment woul\nd have to be determinedand an\n impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly forinvestments in privately \nheld companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and66\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
