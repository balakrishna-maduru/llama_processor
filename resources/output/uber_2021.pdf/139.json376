Captains network represents the fair value of the underlyingnetwork\n with Careem drivers (called \u201cCaptains\u201d). Developed technology represents the fair value of Careem\u2019s technology. Trade names relate to the \u201cCareem\u201dtrade name, trademarks, and\n domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.Tangible\n net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fairvalues. We believe the \namounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant wouldpay for, these intangible \nassets as of January 2, 2020.The\n Asset Purchase Agreement provides for specific indemnities to us in relation to value added tax obligations and other tax reserves of certain jurisdictionswhich\n reflect  potential  tax  liabilities.  We  recognized  $64  million  of  indemnification  assets  on  the  same  basis  as  the  tax  reserves  at  January  2,  2020,  which  isrecorded\n as other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Settlements of these tax reserves, if any, will be funded by the indemnificationasset.\nThe results of the acquired operations were included in our consoli\ndated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January 2, 2020. For the period fromJanuary\n 2, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Careem contributed to a loss before income taxes of $218 million. Revenue for the period from January 2, 2020through December 31, 2020 were not ma\nterial.Cornershop\nIn\n 2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d),operating\n an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial CornershopInvestment\u201d). The rem\naining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During\n the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin\n order for Uber to acquire Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructuredsuch\n that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as \u201cCS-Mexico\u201d), while allof the remaining Cornershop ope\nrations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.On July\n 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico.This\n transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global\n and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial CornershopInvestment\n was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage,\n the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal\n $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe\n outstanding  membership  interests.  As  a  result,  we  obtained  the  controlling  financial  interest  in  CS-Global  and  accounted  for  the  acquisition  as  a  businesscombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition\n transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controllinginterest\n in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of theinterests\n in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico Put/Call\u201d). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-Global)\n or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capitalcontribution\n to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. TheCS-Mexico\n Put/Call, which was exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price, was accounted for separately from theacquisition, and was included in o\nther current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.137\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
