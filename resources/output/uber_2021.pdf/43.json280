We are subject to the FCPAand\n other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political partiesfor the\n purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject toadditional\n compliance  requirements  to  identify  criminal  activity  and  payments  to  sanctioned  parties.  Our  activities  in  certain  countries  with  high  levels  ofcorruption\n enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, orbusiness\n partners  in violation  of various  anti-corruption  laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties  are often outside our control. Ouracquisition\n of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not befamiliar\n with,  and  may  not  have  been  previously  subject  to,  these  anti-corruption  laws.  In  addition,  our  existing  and  future  safeguards,  including  training  andcompliance\n programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be heldresponsible.\n Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users\n and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers\n may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.\nMany\n Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich\n we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,\n and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati\non company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay\n adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed\n Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were\n adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limi\ntations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liabil\nity for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We\n operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers\n may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs\n against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver p\nrogram without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we\n settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with\n this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,\n and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.\n In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.\nOur\n business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers\n change the terms  of such insurance in a manner not favorable  to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to compl\ny with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour\n Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.\n We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited\n number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee\n that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile\n insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability,\n workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable\n to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada\n than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive \ninsurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
