The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss\n experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider\n frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known. Adjustm\nents, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates\n of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance\n claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend\n upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.\nWhile management be\nlieves that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour\n board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs,\n as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting\n condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority\n of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. Th\ne market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We\n account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards,\n which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they o\nccur.We\n have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inp\nuts and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock pr\nice volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black\n-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022\nExpected term. We estimate the exp ected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\u2022\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\u2022\nExpected volatility.  We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour\n own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we cons\nider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\u2022\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is z ero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We\n continue  to  use  judgment  in  evaluating  the  expected  volatility  and  expected  term  utilized  in  our  stock-based  compensation  expense  calculation  on  aprospective\n basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expectedterm, which could mater\nially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee\n Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\u201cFinancial Statements \nand Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
