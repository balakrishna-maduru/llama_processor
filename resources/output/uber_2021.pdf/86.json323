The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities.Refer to Note 10 \u2013 Supplemental Finan\ncial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.Although\n we  pre-authorize  forms  of  payment  to  mitigate  our  exposure,  we  bear  the  cost  of  any  accounts  receivable  losses.  We  record  an  allowance  fordoubtful\n accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions.We consider the allowance for doubtful accounts for\n fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are included as costof\n revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and geographicaltrends,\n which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.

Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight\n\u2011 linemethod over the estima\nted useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:Property and Equipment\nEstimated Useful Life Land\nIndefinite Buildings\n30-45 years Site improvements\n5-15 years Leased vehicles\n3-10 years Computer equipment\n3-5 years Furniture and fixtures\n3-5 years Dockless e-bikes\n3 years Internal-use software\n2 years Leased computer equipment\nShorter of estimated usef ul life or lease termLeasehold improvements\nShorter of estimated usef ul life or lease termWhen assets are retired\n or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain orloss is reflected\n in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.

Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and beginsonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together \nwith costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed asincurred. In addition, we cap\nitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle\n assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
