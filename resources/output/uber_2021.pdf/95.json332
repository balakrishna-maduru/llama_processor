We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future GlobalIntangible Low-taxed Incom\ne (\u201cGILTI\u201d).We have elected to t\nreat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.The\n establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions todetermine the\n fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the\n estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are\n derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although\n we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and externalcomparable\n data  and  are  inherently  uncertain.  Unanticipated  events  and  circumstances  may  occur  that  could  affect  either  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  suchassumptions, estimates or \nactual results.Expenses\nSet forth below is a brief des\ncription of the components of our expenses:\u2022\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily  consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,credit\n card  processing  fees,  bank  fees,  data  center  and  networking  expenses,  mobile  device  and  service  costs,  costs  incurred  for  certain  Deliverytransactions where\n we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freighttransportation servic\nes, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\u2022\nOperations and support expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations incities,\n including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost ofcustomer support, Driver backg\nround checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\u2022\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of co mpensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertisingcosts,\n product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and theallocation\n of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.3 billion,$1.0\n billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, andcredits\n provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and2021, respectively.\n\u2022\nResearch and development expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, designand product development. Expenses inclu\ndes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business inJanuary 2021, as\n well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certaincorporate costs.\n\u2022\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses primarily  consist  of  compensation  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation,  for  executive  management  andadministrative employees, including finance\n and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as wellas\n allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legalsettlements.\n\u2022\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily  consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,leasehold improvements, \nfurniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.Restructuring and Related Charges\nCosts\n associated  with  management-approved  restructuring  activities,  including  reductions  in  headcount,  exiting  a  market  or  consolidation  of  facilities  arerecognized when\n they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use\n assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee terminationbenefits\n either when it is probable that an employee is entitled  to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management hascommunicated\n the termination  plan to employees  and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority  to approve the action,commits\n to a plan of termination;  the plan identifies  the number of employees  to be terminated,  their job classifications  and their  locations,  and the expectedcompletion\n date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefitsthey will receive if \nthey are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will bemade\n or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with thecontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remainin\ng term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognizedat\n the cease-use  date.  Costs associated  with lease  contracts  are  accounted  for under the leasing  accounting  guidance or under the long-lived  assets  accountingguidance.\n93\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
