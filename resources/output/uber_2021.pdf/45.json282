Further, we may be unable to detectinfringement\n of  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  even  if  we  detect  such  violations  and  decide  to  enforce  our  intellectual  property  rights,  we  may  not  besuccessful,\n and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management\u2019sattention.\n Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or anyloss\n of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operatingresults.\nCompanies\n in  the  Internet  and  technology  industries,  and  other  patent  and  trademark  holders,  including  \u201cnon-practicing  entities,\u201d  seeking  to  profit  fromroyalties\n in  connection  with  grants  of  licenses  or  seeking  to  obtain  injunctions,  own  large  numbers  of  patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  and  trade  secrets  andfrequently\n enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue toreceive notices tha\nt claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights.Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in whic\nh we historically have not operated, which could increaseour exposure to patent and othe\nr intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and mayin\n the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we havean\n interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investmentmay materially decline.\nAny\n intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management\u2019sattention\n and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and mayresult\n in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. Further, certain adverseoutcomes of such proceedings cou\nld adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.We\n may  be  required  or  may  opt  to  seek  a  license  for  the  right  to  use  intellectual  property  held  by  others,  which  may  not  be  available  on  commerciallyreasonable\n terms,  or  at  all.  Even  if  a  license  is  available,  we  may  be  required  to  pay  significant  royalties  or  license  fees,  which  may  increase  our  operatingexpenses. We may\n also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effortand\n expense  and  make  us  less  competitive.  If  we  cannot  license  or  develop  alternative  technology,  content,  branding,  or  business  methods  for  any  allegedlyinfringing\n aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any ofthese results could harm ou\nr operating results.Our reported financial results may be adverse\nly affected by changes in accounting principles.The accounting\n for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our businessmodel,\n interpretations  of  relevant  accounting  principles,  enforcement  of  existing  or  new  regulations,  and  changes  in  SEC  or  other  agency  policies,  rules,regulations,\n and  interpretations,  of  accounting  regulations.  Changes  to  our  business  model  and  accounting  methods  could  result  in  changes  to  our  financialstatements,\n including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result inmaterially\n different  financial  results,  and  may  require  that  we  change  how  we  process,  analyze,  and  report  financial  information  and  our  financial  reportingcontrols.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Inv\nestment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.The\n Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conducttheir business activities. We believe that\n we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d underthe\n Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China),\n referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe\n are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment\n company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment\n Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse\n effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements\n of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon \nthe sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe\n market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and\n we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all orpart of your investment.\n43\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
