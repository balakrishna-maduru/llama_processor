As of De\ncember 31, 2020 and 2021, the amounts of non-controlling interests represented by subsidiaries\u2019 preferred units and preferred stockwere $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, r\nespectively.ATG Investment: Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement\nIn July\n 2019, we closed a Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement with SoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO (collectively \u201cthe Investors\u201d) for purchase by the Investorsof Class\n A Preferred Units (\u201cPreferred Units\u201d) in Apparate. Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors foran aggregate considera\ntion of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, thePreferred\n Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2020, we retained the remaining85.8% ownership interest. SoftBank and Toyot\na are our existing investors. At\n the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potentialadjustment,\n as  defined  by  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  at  any  time.  The  Preferred  Units  are  entitled  to  certain  distributions,  including  primarilydividends\n which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate's discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.The Preferred Units are en\ntitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) theoriginal investment\n plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately priorto\n the  sale  or  liquidation  event.  The  quarterly  dividend,  along  with  any  attributed  prorated  share  of  Apparate\u2019s  net  income  (if  applicable),  are  included  in  netincome\n (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units do not participate in net lossesdue to a liquidation pref\nerence.SoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units\nBeginning\n on July 2, 2026, SoftBank has the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at a price equal to thenumber of SoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of\n (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value ofthe\n Preferred Units at the time of conversion (the \u201cPut/Call Price\u201d). Beginning on July 2, 2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held bySoftBank\n at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all, or a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied incash.\n The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they are not separately exercisable or legally detachedfrom the SoftBank Preferred Uni\nts.As\n of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated financial statements andreported\n at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date. The initial fair value of SoftBank\u2019s Preferred Units was determined based on ahybrid\n method with the option pricing model as the primary methodology. This method used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equalprobability\n of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit event. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of42%,\n time to liquidity of 5 years, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from thehybrid\n method  at  issuance  to  evidence  that  the  issuance  price  of  the  Preferred  Units  approximated  their  fair  value.  There  was  no  fair  value  adjustment  toSoftBank\u2019s redeemable non-con\ntrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.Toyota and DENSO\u2019s Preferred Units\nAs of\n December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units  were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subjectto any mandatory redempt\nion rights or redemption rights that are outside our control. ATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO\nIn\n conjunction  with  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  discussed  above,  we  entered  into  a  three-year  joint  collaboration  agreement  among  Toyota,DENSO,\n and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the \u201cATG Collaboration Agreement\u201d), which became effective as of the closing of thePreferred\n Unit  Purchase  Agreement  in  July  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement,  Toyota  would  make  cash  payments  to  Apparate  up  to  anaggregate\n of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual installments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for eachsix-month\n period were contingent upon the mutual agreement between the parties on the development activities and milestones to be achieved in the next sixmonths\n and  the  continuation  of  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement.  The  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement  was  within  the  scope  of  ASC  808,  CollaborativeArrangements.\n The development activities were considered ongoing and central to the activities of ATG. As a result, the amounts received from Toyota wererecognized as collaboration revenue in the All other segment (formerly ATG and Other Technolo\ngy Programs) ratably over the respective six-month service periodto\n which each payment relates, as the related development activities are performed. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we recognized $42million and $100 million, r\nespectively, as revenue under the ATG Collaboration Agreement.Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\n133\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
