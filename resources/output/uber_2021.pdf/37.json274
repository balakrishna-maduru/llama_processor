Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation cou\nld be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.In\n addition, our acquisition  of Careem  has increased  our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices  Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar  laws outside theUnited\n States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such par\nties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We\n may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will beaccretive\n to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.  It  is  also  possible  that  acquisitions,  combinations,  divestitures,  joint  ventures,  or  other  strategic  transactions  weannounce\n could  be  viewed  negatively  by  the  press,  investors,  platform  users,  or  regulators,  any  or  all  of  which  may  adversely  affect  our  reputation  and  ourbusiness. Any of these factors may \nadversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or l\nimited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify ourbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn\n certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model hasbeen\n blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in suchjurisdictions.\n In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk\n revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\n and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity\u2019s\n Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \nand car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto\n comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019,\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\n 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\n such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition,\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United St\nates.
