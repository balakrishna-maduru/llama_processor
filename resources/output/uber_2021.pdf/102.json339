Upon the comple\ntion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab, which was previously accounted for as an investment inan\n available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares, converted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly tradedcompany. We recorded the fair value\n of our investment with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date ofthe\n conversion.  Upon  the  conversion,  we  released  the  accumulative  pre-tax  unrealized  gains  on  the  investment  of  $2.8  billion  recorded  through  othercomprehensive\n income  and  recognized  them  as  unrealized  gains  in  other  income  (expense),  net  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  operations  for  year  endedDecember\n 31,  2021.  Subsequent  to  the  conversion,  we  recognized  unrealized  losses  of  $1.2  billion  on  the  investment  in  other  income  (expense),  net  in  ourconsolidated statemen\nt of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the fair value change of the equity security.As of December 31, 2021, our Grab investmen\nt has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the tablepresenting our financia\nl assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.The\n following  table  summarizes  information  about  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  the  fair  value  measurement  for  our  Grab  investment  as  ofDecember 31, 2020:\nFair value method\nRelative weighting Key unobservable input Financing transactions\n100% Transaction price per share $6.16 Volatility\n53% Estimated time to liquidity\n1.75 years During\n the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below their amortized cost basedon\n an analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab\u2019s publicly-traded competitive peer group and representative stock market indices. These observed inputswere\n considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that wasapplied\n to  the  valuation  derived  from  Grab\u2019s  latest  financing  transaction  which  occurred  earlier  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and  prior  to  the  announcement  ofCOVID-19\n as  a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As  a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was  reduced  by$230\n million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,representing\n the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balancesheet\n and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  thesignificant\n uncertainty about Grab\u2019s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected wasconsidered\n to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost wasconsidered to reflect a credit-related\n impairment charge.The\n fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by theinvestee during that quar\nter. As a result, we recognized a reversal of the previously recorded allowance for100\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
