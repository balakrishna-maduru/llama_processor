Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as wel\nl as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.We\n are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries.\nThese\n government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.\n If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange\n our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational\n harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations. Any of these deve\nlopments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We\n face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory act\nion, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The\n nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These\n and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international  privacy, data protection, and other laws. Suchviolations\n subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities\n in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject\n of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto\n which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect\n consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future\n failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6\n million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice\n of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulatedjudgments\n with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand\n assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,enforcement\n actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced\n by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities\n that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14,\n 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat\n Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed \nand may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This\n risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally,\n we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security. The EU adopted the GDP\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\n and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal\n data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal\n data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR\n further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories\n of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual\n decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming\n our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,\n including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside\n the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California \nConsumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew\n operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst\n businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states\n have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides\n another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These\n laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)\n39\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
