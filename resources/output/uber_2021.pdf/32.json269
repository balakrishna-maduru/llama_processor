Any failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climatechange\n commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand,reputation, and consequently, ou\nr business.Dependencies on Third Parties\nThe\n successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under ourcontrol.\nOur\n business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internetinfrastructure\n or  GPS  signals  or  the  failure  of  telecommunications  network  operators  to  provide  us  with  the  bandwidth  we  need  to  provide  our  products  andofferings have interfered, and could continue to\n interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attemptto\n access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, andmay\n use our competitors\u2019 products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunicationsoperators.\n If  mobile  Internet  access  fees  or  other  charges  to  Internet  users  increase,  consumer  traffic  may  decrease,  which  may  in  turn  cause  our  revenue  tosignificantly decrease.\nOur\n business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as apower\n outage,  telecommunications  delay  or  failure,  security  breach,  or  computer  virus  could  result  in  delays  or  interruptions  to  our  products,  offerings,  andplatform,\n as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,and\n local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, andsubject\n us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop newproducts\n to  mitigate  the  impact  of  potential  interruptions  to  mobile  communications  systems,  which  can  be  used  by  consumers  in  territories  where  mobilecommunications systems a\nre less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.We\n rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.If such third parties interfere with the distr\nibution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.Our\n platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available fordownload.\n We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaceswill not\n charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users\u2019 permission to track their activities acrossthird-party\n apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness ofsuch\n advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users onour platform.\n We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is criticalto\n the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offerour\n platform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it ispossible\n that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do notprovide access to such softwar\ne on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we maybe\n required  to  seek  comparable  software  from  other  sources,  which  may  be  more  expensive  or  inferior,  or  may  not  be  available  at  all,  any  of  which  wouldadversely affect our bus\niness.Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across de\nvices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.One\n of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Ourplatform\n is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platformacross\n these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and wemay\n not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability,whether due to actions of thi\nrd parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.We\n rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable orunavailable on favorable terms, our business could be advers\nely affected.The\n convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties forelements\n of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse torenew\n our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us onacceptable terms o\nr at all, our business may be30\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
