For more information about how we use these non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limi\ntations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financialmeasures, see the section tit\nled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201dMonthly\n Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs  is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder\n on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform\n in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  oftransactions, which are key \nfactors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. \nWe  define  Trips  as  the  number  of  completed  consumer  Mobility  or  New  Mobility  rides  and  Delivery  orders  in  a  given  period.  For  example,  anUberPOOL\n ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe thatTrips are a useful met\nric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n60\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
