Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control overfinancial\n reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)(PCAOB)\n and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  andregulations of the Securi\nties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\n about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti\nng was maintained in all material respects.Our\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding\n the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates\n made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th\ne circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As\n described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d) and TupeloParent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 3\n1, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company inpurchase\n business combinations during 2021.
