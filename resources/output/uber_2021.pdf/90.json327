The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers\n and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The\n acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants \nafter the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The\n Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat\ne the completion of a successful transaction.In\n 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,\n we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.\n We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized \ntotal revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,\n during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those\n markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember\n 31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del\nivery transactions.In all\n markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou\nr customers.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in\n determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof\n revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties\n to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo\ntions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For\n the majority  of Mobility and Delivery transactions,  our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants  to facilitate  a successful  trip orDelivery\n service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor\n otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform\n the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.\n As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand\n Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th\ne services provided to end-users.In\n the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting  end-users seeking Mobility and Deliveryservices\n with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a\n net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice\n to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery\n services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi\nces.Mobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider\ns and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf\norm. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending\n on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an\n end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,\n end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.\n Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of \na trip.88\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
