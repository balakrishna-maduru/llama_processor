The estimated fair value of the consideration receivedincluded the investment v\nalued at $171 million and the $35 million of reimbursement of goods and services tax receivable from Zomato. As of December 31, 2021,we had collected substantially all of\n the receivable. The fair value of the CCPS Preferred Shares was based primarily on the observed transaction price for a similarsecurity\n issued to new investors in close proximity to the time of our transaction with Zomato. The transaction resulted in a gain on disposal of $154 millionrecognized\n in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2020. The income tax effect of the sale was notmaterial.\n The divestiture  of Uber Eats India did not represent  a strategic  shift that would have had a major  effect  on our operations  and financial  results, andtherefore does not quali\nfy for reporting as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes.Divestiture of JUMP and Investment in Lime\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements wit\nh Lime to divest our JUMP business (the \u201cJUMP Divestiture\u201d). Neutron Holdings,Inc.\n (\u201cLime\u201d)  is  incorporated  in  Delaware  for  the  purpose  of  owning  and  operating  a  fleet  of  dockless  e-bikes  and  e-scooters  for  short-term  access  use  byconsumers for personal tr\nansportation. We previously held Lime Series C preferred stock and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series C-1 preferred stock.Uber\n contributed hardware, equipment, intellectual property rights, technology, licensed technology, and permits of our JUMP business (collectively, \u201cJUMPAssets\u201d)\n in certain markets to Lime. JUMP Assets and previously held investments and warrants in Lime were exchanged for common stock (the \u201cLime CommonStock\u201d),\n newly  issued  Lime  Series  1-C  preferred  stock  (\u201cLime  1-C  Preferred  Stock\u201d)  and  fully  vested  warrants  to  purchase  Lime  Series  1-C  Preferred  Stock(\u201cLime\n 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants\u201d). Lime Common Stock represents approximately 10% of fully-diluted (22% undiluted) ownership interest in Lime as ofDecember 31, 2021.\nConcurrently,\n we  contributed  $85  million  of  cash  to  Lime  in  exchange  for  a  secured  note  convertible  into  Lime  Series  3  Preferred  Stock  (the  \u201cLimeConvertible\n Note\u201d),  which  may  be  converted  at  any  time  at  our  election  representing  20%  initial  ownership  in  Lime  as  converted  on  a  fully-diluted  basis.  Inaddition,\n we entered into a call option agreement which gives us for a two-year period beginning May 7, 2022 the right to acquire all of the outstanding equityinterests\n of Lime held by its shareholders at fair value on the date of exercise, subject to regulatory approval. We have one seat on Lime\u2019s five-person board ofdirectors.

Lime wasassessed under the VIE model and cons\nidered an unconsolidated VIE. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for additional information.The\n JUMP Divestiture did not represent a strategic shift that would cause a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualifyfor\n reporting as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. The resulting loss on disposal was not material to us and was recorded in other income(expense), net, in the consol\nidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2020.Divestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\nOn\n January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization ofautonomous\n vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownershipof the ATG Business transferred to Auror\na.As\n consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A StatedLiquidation\n Preference  of  $1.1  billion,  which  had  previously  been  recorded  as  redeemable  and  non-redeemable  non-controlling  interests  on  our  consolidatedbalance\n sheet prior to this transaction.
