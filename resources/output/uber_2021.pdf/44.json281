Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses\n for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.\n While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves.\n We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on ou\nr unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We\n may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse\n our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings\n on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability\n insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to\n have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot\n result  in  liability,  we could incur  significant  costs in investigating  and defending  against  them.  If insurers  become  insolvent,  they may not be  able  to payotherwise\n valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may besubject to negative publi\ncity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition,  we  are  subject  to  local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  relating  to  insurance  coverage  which  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental\n entities  or  others.  Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional\n legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders\n and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\n us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings\n or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to in\ncrease our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulat\nions, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue\n is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,\n and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer\n fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further,\n in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional\n regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject\n of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including\n rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number ofmunicipalities\n have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As aresult, we may be forced to \nchange our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.If\n we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property ofothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be advers\nely affected.Our\n intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardwaredesigns,\n registered  and  unregistered  trademarks,  trademark  applications,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable),  patents,  and  patentapplications.
