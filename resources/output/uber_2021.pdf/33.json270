For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such feesresult\n in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is noassurance that such online payment providers will not\n pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operatingcosts will increase, which cou\nld adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\n addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and havecaused\n substantial  Driver  dissatisfaction  and  generated  a  significant  number  of  Driver  complaints.  Future  failures  of  the  payment  processing  infrastructureunderlying\n our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors\u2019 platforms. If the qualityor\n convenience  of  our  payment  processing  infrastructure  declines  as  a  result  of  these  limitations  or  for  any  other  reason,  the  attractiveness  of  our  business  toDrivers,\n merchants,  and  carriers  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  we  are  forced  to  migrate  to  other  third-party  payment  service  providers  for  any  reason,  thetransition would require sign\nificant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.We\n currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in servicesfrom these third parties could impair \nthe delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.We\n use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physicaloperation\n of  any of  the co-located  data  centers  we use  or the  operations  of  our third-party  service  providers.  These third-party  operations  and  co-located  datacenters\n may experience  break-ins,  computer  viruses, denial-of-service  attacks,  sabotage,  acts of vandalism,  and other misconduct.  These facilities  may also bevulnerable\n to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  and  similar  events.  Oursystems\n do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party serviceproviders\n to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or requireus\n to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of\n which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switchto\n another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference  to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and o\nur co-located data center facilitieshave\n no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities oncommercially\n reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center isarranged.\n Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their servicesthrough\n our  platform,  and  reduce  use  of  our  platform  by  consumers  and  shippers.  Our  business  and  operating  results  may  be  harmed  if  current  and  potentialDrivers,\n consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computationalcapacity\n sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,which would have an adverse effe\nct on our growth and business.Our use of third-party open source software could adversely a\nffect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.We\n use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open sourcesoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source soft\nware and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may besubject\n to  suits  by  parties  claiming  ownership  of  what  we  believe  to  be  open  source  software,  or  claiming  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  open  sourcelicensing\n terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open sourcesoftware to make available\n all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designedto monitor our\n compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource\n license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms\n of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source\n software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation\n of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain po\nrtions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In\n addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source\n licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.  Use  of  open  source  software  may  also  presentadditional security risks because the public availability of such soft\nware may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise ourplatform.\n Additionally,  because  any  software  source  code  that  we  make  available  under  an  open  source  license  or  that  we  contribute  to  existing  open  sourceprojects becomes public\nly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we31\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
