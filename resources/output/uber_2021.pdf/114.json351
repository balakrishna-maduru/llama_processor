Therefore,the 2025 Convertible Notes are c\nlassified as long-term.The initial\n conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately$80.84\n per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid specialinterest.\nUpon\n conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash andshares of\n our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, atour\n option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for atleast\n 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, andincluding,\n the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amountof the notes to be redeem\ned, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.The\n indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, theincurrence of indebtedn\ness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.Prior\n to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recordedas\n equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent\n (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent\n of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured\n as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used th\ne binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective\n January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital\n of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening\n accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili\nty measured at its amortized cost.The\n fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered \na Level 2 valuation input.Senior Notes\nIn\n October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-year\n notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  \u201c2026  Senior  Notes\u201d)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.\n We issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs.
