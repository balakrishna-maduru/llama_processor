Refunds to end-users due to end-user dissatisfactionwith the Platform are r\necorded as marketing expenses and reduce the accounts receivable amount associated with the corresponding transaction.Other\nWe\n have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenueproducing transactions, and co\nllected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not includedas a component of revenue or \ncost of revenue.Practical Expedients\nWe\n have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contractswith an original expected \nlength of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.Stock-Based Compensation\nWe\n account  for  stock-based  compensation  expense  in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  recognition  and  measurement  provisions  of  GAAP,  which  requirescompensation\n cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when theyoccur.\n The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,using appropriate valuat\nion techniques.Service-Based Awards\nWe\n record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSU(s)\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the requisiteservice period, which is gene\nrally four years.For stock options with service-based vesting\n conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,typically\n the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interestrates.\n We  estimate  the  volatility  of  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant  based  on  the  weighted-average  historical  stock  price  volatility  of  our  own  shares  orcomparable\n publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant witha\n term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201doptions, as\n our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expectedterm\n for  non-employees\u2019  options  based  on  the  contractual  term.  U.S.  The  expected  dividend  yield  is  0.0%  as  we  have  not  paid  and  do  not  anticipate  payingdividends on our common stock.\nPerformance-Based Awards\nWe\n have granted restricted common stock awards (\u201cRSA(s)\u201d), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR(s)\u201d), stock options, and warrants that vest upon thesatisfaction\n of  both  service-based  and  performance-based  conditions.  The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  Theperformance-based\n conditions  generally  are  satisfied  upon  achieving  specified  performance  targets,  such  as  our  financial  or  operating  metrics,  and/or  theoccurrence\n of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial publicoffering\n (\u201cIPO\u201d).  We  record  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  performance-based  equity  awards  such  as  RSAs,  RSUs,  SARs,  and  stock  options  on  anaccelerated attribution method over\n the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable tobe satisfied.\nPrior\n to  our IPO in  May  2019,  we had  not  recognized  stock-based  compensation  expense  for  awards  with  performance-based  conditions  which  include  aqualifying\n event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable. Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulativeone-time\n stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-based awards after the IPO is r\necorded over the remaining requisite service period. Refer to Note 11 \u2013 Stockholders' Equity for further information on our IPO.For performance-based awa\nrds and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.For performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we\n determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-based awards.\n91\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
