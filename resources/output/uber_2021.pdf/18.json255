Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all orpart of our or the targe\nt company\u2019s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.For\n all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively wouldhave an adverse effec\nt on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.To\n remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, andmay\n continue to  offer,  significant  Driver incentives  and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely  affected  and may  continue to adverselyaffect our financial performance.\nTo\n remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or servicefees, and we have\n offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,we\n have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver\n receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets andregions,\n we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand\n promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions\n will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect,\n our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified\n over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Driver\ns. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe\n application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in \nthe future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compet\ne have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill\n continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.  Moreover,  certain  of  our  stockholders,  including  SoftBank  (a  large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain\n of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe\n future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete moreeffectively\n against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,\n shippers,  and  carriers  to  their  platform  and  away  from  ours.  Such  competitive  pressures  may  lead  us  to  maintain  or  lower  fares  or  service  fees  ormaintain\n or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relativelynascent, and we can\nnot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.We\n have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeabl\ne future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating lo\nsses of $8.6 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31,2019,\n 2020 and 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levelsand\n decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, wemay not be able to maintain\n or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses,as we\n continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,and\n promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hireadditional employees; and\n add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed inincreasing\n our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increaserevenue or\n contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect toadd\n value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lowerservice\n fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in anegative\n take  rate  with  respect  to  those  transactions  after  considering  amounts  collected  from  consumers  and  paid  to  Drivers.  As  we  expand  our  offerings  toadditional\n cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve ormaintain\n profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect toachieve as a result of ou\nr acquisition of Careem and Postmates, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in16\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
