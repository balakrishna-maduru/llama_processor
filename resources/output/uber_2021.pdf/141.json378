For the period from July 6, 2020through December 31, 2020, CS-Global contribu\nted an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.In December 2020, we received \napproval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercisedthe\n call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexicothrough\n our  ownership  in  CS-Global.  The  acquisition  of  CS-Mexico  was  accounted  for  as  a  business  combination.  The  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  theconsideration\n transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial, and consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fairvalue\n of  the  CS-Mexico  Put/Call  remeasured  at  the  acquisition  date.  As  a  result  of  remeasuring  our  prior  CS-Mexico  Put/Call  held  immediately  prior  to  thebusiness\n combination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss was included in other income (expense), net in theconsolidated statemen\nt of operations.In\n August  2021,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  the  remaining  45%  ownership  interest  in  Cornershop  (or  47%,  on  a  fully-diluted  basis)  in  an  all-stocktransaction.\n As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 millionrestricted\n shares  issued  to  certain  Cornershop  employees.  In  addition,  we  issued  4  million  stock  options  to  replace  assumed  outstanding  stock  options.  Thesereplacement stock opt\nions attributable to post-acquisition service are included in our option activity and are recognized as stock-based compensation expense.The\n acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize again\n or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the previously recognizednon-controlling interes\nt was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.The total purchase\n price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber\u2019s share price on the closing date. The fair value ofthe\n 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on theemployees\u2019\n continuing employment at the combined company for the next three years. These restricted shares are considered compensation for post-combinationservices and will be recogn\nized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over the next three years.Postmates\nOn\n July 5, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% ownership interest in Postmates, an on-demand delivery platform in theU.S.\nOn\n December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates, bringing together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates\u2019 distinctivedelivery\n business  in  the  U.S.  As  a  result  of  the  transaction,  we  obtained  ownership  interest  in  Postmates  through  our  voting  rights,  and  the  transaction  wasaccounted\n for  as a  business  combination.  The  acquisition  date  fair  value  of  the  consideration  transferred  for  Postmates  was  approximately  $3.9  billion,  whichconsisted of the following (in \nmillions):Fair Value\nUber common stock transfer\nred$ 3,494 Note receivable\n100 Stock-based compensation awards \nattributable to pre-combination services308 Total consideration\n$ 3,902 The\n fair value of the $3.5 billion common stock issued (70 million shares of our common stock), as consideration transferred was determined on the basis ofthe\n closing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date. We determined the fair value of the equity awards for stock options assumed using a Black-Scholes\n option pricing model with the applicable assumptions as of the acquisition date. The fair value of equity awards for RSUs was determined by using theclosing market price o\nf our common stock on the acquisition date adjusted by an exchange ratio.139\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
