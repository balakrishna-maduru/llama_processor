(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers\n (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)\n with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery andother\n delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas\n \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\ners with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d).\n We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\nliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\n differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\n risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\n issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.\n We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited\n number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment serviceproviders\n are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nWe\n have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Our  operations  havehistorically\n been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolvingcredit\n facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,additional capital may\n need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able toobtain additional\n82\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
