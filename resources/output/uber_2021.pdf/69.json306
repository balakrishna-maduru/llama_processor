Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairmentcharges.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe\n review  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  (in  the  fourth  quarter)  and  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  goodwill  might  beimpaired.\n We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carryingvalues\n for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers reviewfinancial results, evaluate perf\normance, and allocate resources.Judgment\n in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,business,\n and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affectingthe reporting\n unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.\nPerforming\n a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions.\n These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,risk-adjusted discount\n rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss Contingencies\nWe\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations,  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\n course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We\n review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated\n reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.  We  make  adjustments  to  our  provisions  and  changes  to  our  disclosures  accordingly  to  reflect  the  impact  ofnegotiations,\n settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and theestimated\n amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to changebased on new information and futu\nre events.The\n outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst\n us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reportingperiod in which any such outcome be\ncomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income Taxes\nWe\n are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.  Theestablishment\n of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  todetermine the\n fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the\n estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are\n derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although\n we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal andexternal\n comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of suchassumptions, estimates or \nactual results.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will besustained\n upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require makingjudgments,\n assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final taxoutcome\n of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To theextent\n that the final tax outcome of these matters  is different  than the amounts recorded,  such differences  may impact the provision for income taxes and theeffective tax ra\nte in the period in which such determination is made.The\n provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,we are\n subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularlyassess the likelihood of adve\nrse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
