It isalso\n possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development effortswith\n respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from ourmore\n established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities maysubject\n us  to  new  rules  or  restrictions  in  response  to  our  innovations  that  could  increase  our  expenses  or  prevent  us  from  successfully  commercializing  newproducts, offerings\n or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospectsmay be harmed.\nOur\n business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we areunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internat\nionally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.As\n of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 72 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 78% of all Trips.We have\n limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments toexpand\n our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not besuccessful and may negativ\nely affect our operating results.Conducting\n our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the samedegree in the United States. Th\nese risks include, among others:\u2022\noperational and compli ance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\u2022\nthe  resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptationof our operations to local p\nractices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;\u2022\nlaws  and  regulations  more  restrictive  than  those  in  the  United  States,  including  laws  governing  competition,  pricing,  payment  methods,  Internetactivities,\n transportation  services  (such  as  taxis  and  vehicles  for  hire),  transportation  network  companies  (such  as  ridesharing),  logistics  services,payment\n processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening andbackground\n checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,ownership of intellectua\nl property, and other activities important to our business;\u2022\ncompetition with companies or other  services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existingrelationships with potenti\nal platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;\u2022\ndiffering levels of soc ial acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\u2022\ndiffering levels of t echnological compatibility with our platform;\u2022\nexposure to business cultures in whi ch improper business practices may be prevalent;\u2022\nlegal  uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or alack of clear legal precedent;\n\u2022\ndifficulties  in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of laborunions, employee represent\native bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\u2022\nfluctuations in curren cy exchange rates;\u2022\nmanaging operations in ma rkets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\u2022\nregulations governing the  control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in thesame currencies, as wel\nl as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\u2022\nadverse  tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation ofearnings;\n\u2022\nincreased financia l accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;21\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
