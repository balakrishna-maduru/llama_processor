Evidence of a loss in value might include, butwould\n not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  absence  of  an  ability  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  or  inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity\n that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults\n and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe\n evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof\n an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount\n of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re\ncognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair\n value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe\n measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\ne inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,\n accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.  Refer  to Note 3 \u2013Investments and Fair Value Me\nasurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest Entities\nWe\n evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use\n of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity\n for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial\n statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly\n affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and (2)  has  the obligation  to  absorb losses  or  the right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially\n be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether\n we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with app\nlicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue Recognition\nWe\n recognize  revenue  when  or  as  we  satisfy  our  obligations.  We  derive  our  revenues  principally  from  Drivers\u2019  and  Merchants\u2019  use  of  our  platform,  on-demand\n lead generation,  and related  services,  including facilitating  payments from end-users. The service  enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive  andfulfill\n on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we alsogenerate\n revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fromcustomers' use of Freight serv\nices.We periodically re\nassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
