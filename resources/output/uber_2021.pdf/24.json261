Our growth strategyhas\n also  included  the  divestment  of  certain  lines  of  businesses  in  its  entirety,  and  not  just  in  certain  jurisdictions,  and  instead  partnering  and  investing  in  ourcompetitors\n in  those  lines  of  businesses.  As  a  result,  a  significant  portion  of  our  assets  includes  minority  ownership  positions,  including  in  Didi,  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lim\ne, Zomato and Aurora.Our ownership\n in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors ofDidi\n or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi andZomato.\n We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day\n management  of  Grab,  our  Yandex.Taxi  joint  venture,  Lime  or  Aurora.  Although  we  are  represented  on  each  of  the  boards  of  directors  of  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi\n joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams ofthese\n companies  may  make  decisions  or  take  actions  with  which  we  disagree  or  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  value  of  our  ownership  in  these  companies.Additionally, these\n companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in variousmarkets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our owner\nship interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects would be adversely a\nffected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.Any\n material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets\n is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch\n valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies couldadversely\n impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave\n limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information\n is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic,\n tax, political,  legal, safety, regulatory  and public health risks, including the extent of the impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic  on their business; aredomiciled\n or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a\n result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe\n relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.\n Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operatingresults, or the trading pr\nice of our common stock.Further,\n we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora\u2019s November 2021 initial publicoffering, we\n are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market forany of these securities, and there may be no market\n in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at atime\n at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder\n the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot\n be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never rea\nlize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.We\n may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability,  our prospects would be adverselyaffected and investors may lose so\nme or all of the value of their investment.22\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
