The current year tax expense and any subsequent changes in the recognition ormeasurement of this de\nferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing operations.Based\n on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferredtax\n assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax\n assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences\n and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions\n and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets,\n our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax\n assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable\n to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and\n tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an addi\ntional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The\n indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can\n affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we\n realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities be\ning used as a source of income.As\n of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover\n period. As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $10.2 billion that begin to expire in 2022 and $2.2 billion that have anunlimited\n carryover period. As of December 31, 2021, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $507 million that begin to expire in 2023 and $10.1 billion that havean unlimited carryove\nr period.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $785 million that begin to expire in 2028.
