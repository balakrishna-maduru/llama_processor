The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven by adecrease in our operating lease right-of-use assets, prepaid expense\ns and other assets and increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by loweraccounts payable and \noperating lease liabilities.Investing Activities\nNet\n cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses,net of cash acquired,\n $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases ofnotes\n receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3billion, proceeds from th\ne sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.Net\n cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily consisting of $2.1 billion in purchases of marketablesecurities, $1.5 billion in acquisition of busine\nsses, net of cash acquired and $616 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds frommaturities and sales o\nf marketable securities of $1.4 billion.Financing Activities\nNet\n cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.8  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  primarily  consisting  of  $1.5  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance\n of notes, net of issuance cost, $675 million of proceeds from the issuance and sale of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million ofprincipal\n repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (\u201cCareem Notes\u201d) and $226 million principalpayments on finance leas\nes.Net\n cash  provided  by  financing  activities  was  $1.4  billion  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  primarily  consisting  of  $2.6  billion  of  proceeds  fromissuance of\n notes, net of issuance costs and $247 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $891 million of principalrepayment on Careem Notes and $527 \nmillion of principal repayment on term loan and notes.Other Information\nAs\n of December 31, 2021, $2.2 billion of our $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the UnitedStates\n may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result inimmaterial\n tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We arein compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of December 31, 202\n1, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sourcesof\n funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capitalrequirements,\n collateral  requirements,  potential  acquisitions,  potential  prepayments  of  contested  indirect  tax  assessments  (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d),  and  other  liquidityrequirements through at\n least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidityduring\n the COVID-19 pandemic. As the circumstances around the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to actively monitor the pandemic's impactto us worldwide including our financ\nial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.Purchase Commitments\nWe\n have non-cancelable commitments for network and cloud services, background checks, and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amountsare\n determined based on the non-cancelable quantities or termination amounts to which we are contractually obligated. As of December 31, 2021, we had $394million in non-cancel\nable commitments, with varying expiration terms through December 15, 2026.Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe\n believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating ourconsolidated\n financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate\n to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen\n used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenu\ne and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon\n various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying\n values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty invol\nved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
