We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated\n to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand\n related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other terminatio\nn benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These\n activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the\n largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability\n to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter\n 2020 planned cost structure.
