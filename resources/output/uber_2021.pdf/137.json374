Refer  to  Note  18  \u2013  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation.\n As of December 31, 2020, the non-controlling interest in CS-Global was classified as redeemable non-controlling interest because it is subject to aput/call\n agreement  which was  not solely  in our  control  to  exercise.  At  each  balance  sheet  date,  the redeemable  non-controlling  interest  was measured  using adiscounted\n cash  flow  methodology  and  the  carrying  value  was  adjusted  if  the  fair  value  was  higher  than  the  carrying  value.  The  initial  fair  value,  as  of  theacquisition date\n of July 6, 2020, was $290 million. There were no fair value adjustments to CS-Global\u2019s redeemable non-controlling interest during the year endedDecember\n 31,  2020.
