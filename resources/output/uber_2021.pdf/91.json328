On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect ourservice fee\n from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As wecurrently\n have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, weconcluded\n collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidatedfinancial statements until collected\n from Drivers.Mobility revenue also inc\nludes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products and Vehicle Solutions.Delivery\nWe\n derive  our  Delivery  revenue  primarily  from  service  fees  paid  by  Couriers  and  Merchants  for  use  of  the  platform  and  related  service  to  successfullycomplete\n a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as wellas select other goods. We r\necognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.In\n the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the differencebetween\n the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while wepay\n Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. Wetypically receive the service fee \nwithin a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.Freight\nWe\n derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) during thefourth\n quarter  of  2021,  our  Freight  revenue  also  includes  revenue  from  transportation  management.  Refer  to  Note  18  \u2013  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation on the Transpl\nace acquisition.Brokerage\nBrokerage\n revenue  represents  the  gross  amount  of  fees  charged  to  Shippers  for  our  services  because  we  control  the  service  provided  to  customers.  Costsincurred\n with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.\n We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the shipment  request  establishesenforceable\n rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate\n contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment\n by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper\u2019s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent\n freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod\n of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment \nfor our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation Management\nWe\n provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation service\ns. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese\n services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a grossbasis\n in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costsincurred\n with  carriers  for  these  transactions  are  recorded  in  cost  of  revenue.  In  transactions  where  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  to  customers,  werecognize\n revenue on a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin todestination\n by a third-party carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are notmaterial. Payment fo\nr our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment\n is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered into with a Shipper wherewe\n are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to theShipper.\n We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrierthat\n meets the Shipper's specifications. We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.Accordingly,\n we are the principal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to customers and recognize the relatedrevenue on a net basis. Contracts where we do n\not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years ended December 31, 2019,2020 and 2021.\n89\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
