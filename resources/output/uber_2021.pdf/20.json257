Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and cons\numers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries\n through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide\n rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materiallydifferent\n type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in anefficient\n manner,  which  could  be  costly  and  time-consuming.  Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges\n to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired\n to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.  Furthermore,  we  rely  on  a  single  background-checkprovider in certain\n jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms orat\n all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Driversundergoing periodic background ch\necks that are required to continue using our platform.Maintaining\n and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  business  prospects.  We  have  previously  received  significant  media  coverage  andnegative\n publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintainor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining\n and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  ability  to  attract  new  employees  and  platform  users,  to  preserve  and  deepen  theengagement\n of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverseplatform user sentiment.\nWe\n have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust\n of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult\n for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny,\n and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their inves\ntments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we\n released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on\n our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to h\nave occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto\n result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Furtherunfavorable\n media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.  As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes\n increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave\n an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have\n or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harmto their brands could advers\nely impact our brand and reputation.Our\n brand  and  reputation  might  also  be  harmed  by  events  outside  of  our  control.  For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures\n and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual\n protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be\n aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice,\n are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour\n reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.\nWhile\n we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood\n reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quali\nty of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia\n strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and  potential  competitors  will  expand  theirofferings,\n which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain ourbrand\n in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand andreputation would be further d\namaged and our business may suffer.18\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
