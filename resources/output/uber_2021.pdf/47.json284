In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subjectto\n certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding theseand\n other provisions, see the risk factor titled \u201c-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness.

We may issue our shares of commonstock or securities convertible or\n exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investmentsor otherwise. For\n example, on December 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates for aggregate consideration of approximately 70 million shares of ourcommon\n stock and equity awards covering approximately 13 million shares of our common stock. This and any other such issuance, including the issuance ofadditional\n shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the tradingprice of our common stock to d\necline.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the forese\neable future.We\n have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansionof\n our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
