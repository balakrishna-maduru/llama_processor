As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controllinginterests\n in the ATG Business were settled and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora. We derecognized the carrying value of non-controllinginterests\n in  the  ATG  Business  of  $1.1  billion,  which  included  Toyota  and  DENSO  non-redeemable  non-controlling  interests  of  $701  million  and  Softbank\u2019sredeemable non-contro\nlling interests of $356 million. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information.Freight Holding\nAs\n of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we owned 85% and 78%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary Freight Holding, or79% and 75%, respectively, on a\n fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our Freight Holding employee incentive plan were issued andoutstanding.\n As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, under the Freight Holding incentive plan, a total number of 99.8 million shares of Freight Holding are reserved.As\n of December 31, 2020 and 2021, 83.8 million and 85.0 million shares, respectively, were available for grant and issuance. The redeemable non-controllinginterest of Freight H\nolding is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable.Holders of Common Stock of Freight Holding\nThe\n minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight Holding, including any holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equityincentive\n plans and employees who hold fully vested shares, have put rights to sell certain of their equity interests at fair value to us at specified periods of timethat\n terminates upon the earliest of the closing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the subsidiary. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfied ineither\n cash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock based upon our election. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the minority common stockholdersownership in Freight Holding is classi\nfied as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control.We\n attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding\u2019s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable non-controlling interestsgenerated from common sh\nares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority shareholders of common shares during the period.Freight Series A Preferred Stock\nIn October 2020, Freight Holdi\nng entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight Series A Investor. Pursuant tothe\n 2020  Freight  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  Purchase  Agreement,  the  2020  Freight  Series  A  Investor  agreed  to  invest  an  aggregate  of  $500  million  in  FreightHolding, which will occur over a numbe\nr of closings, subject to customary closing conditions.On October 6, 2020, the initial clos\ning occurred pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and 2020 Freight Series A Investorinvested $250 million in exch\nange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock, representing approximately 8% ownership interest on a fully dilutedbasis.\nThe 2020 Freight Series\n A Investor has the option to purchase additional shares in tranches of at least $50 million at a time at the initial purchase price for twoyears\n following initial closing up to an additional aggregate $250 million. This right to continue to invest at the initial price over two years is a forward obligationclassified\n as a liability measured at fair value which was initially valued using a two-year discount rate and is immaterial. We will maintain majority ownership ofthe\n issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Freight  Holding  following  such  additional  investment.  Upon  the  passage  of  two  years  from  initial  close,  the  2020Freight Series\n A Investor must purchase and Freight Holding must issue any remaining unissued additional shares at the purchase price.
