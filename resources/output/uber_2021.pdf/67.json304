For  additional  information,  see  the  disclosure  included  in  Note  1  \u2013  Description  of  Business  and  Summary  of  SignificantAccounting\n Policies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  \u201cFinancial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,\u201d  of  thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe\n derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products andDelivery\n offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users\n to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.\n The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\nWe\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\n of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r\neduction of revenue.Business Combinations\nWe\n allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair\n values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations\n require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible\n assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and\n trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.\nManagement's\n estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,\n actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired\n finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During\n the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset \nto goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded Derivatives\nDuring\n 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed ofconversion\n options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the totalnumber\n of shares  of our common  stock delivered  to settle  these embedded  features  will have a fixed value.  These conversion options are  bifurcated  from  theunderlying\n instrument  and  accounted  for  and  valued  separately  from  the  host  instrument.  Embedded  derivatives  are  recognized  as  derivative  liabilities  on  ourconsolidated\n balance  sheet.  We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income(expense), net in our consolid\nated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We\n value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial PublicOffering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option \n(\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible65\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
