New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures fo\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\nenueIn\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration\n agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consid\neration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to Customers\nIncentives\n provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue\n of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\nl.In\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\nWe\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user\n discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or\n generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries\n during a limited  time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers  as sales and marketingexpenses at the time th\ney are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:\n These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand\n the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referringend-user.\n These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales andmarketing expenses at the\n time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide\n promotions: These  promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants toend-users\n who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under oursubscription\n offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.Accordingly, we record the cost o\nf these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.90\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
