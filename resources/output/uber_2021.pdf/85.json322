COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\n and  \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.  In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce\n around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations,\n financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture\n developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the\n outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets;\n governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain \nand cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash\n and  cash equivalents  consist  of  cash held  in checking  and savings  accounts  as  well as  investments  in  money market  funds, commercial  paper,  U.S.government\n and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.  We  consider  all  highly-liquid  investments  purchased  with  an  original  or  remaining  maturity  of  threemonths\n or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, whichare included in accru\ned and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash\n and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies andalso\n include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents areclassified\n as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalentsand restricted cash and \ncash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):As of December 31,\n2019\n2020 2021 Cash and cash equivalents\n$ 10,873 $ 5,647 $ 4,295 Restricted cash and cash equ\nivalents - current99 250 631 Restricted cash and cash equ\nivalents - non-current1,095 1,494 2,879 Total cash and cash equival\nents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$ 12,067 $ 7,391 $ 7,805 Collateral Held by Insurer\nCollateral\n held by insurer  represents  funds held by James  River Group companies  (\u201cJames  River\u201d).  These funds, previously held in a trust  account,  werewithdrawn by James River during the fourth\n quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to oneof\n our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under theindemnification agreements\n for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet . Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is presented as collate\nral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet  as of December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2021\n, in connection with the lega cy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented ascollateral\n held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral  held by insurer tonon-current restric\nted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance she et as of December 31, 2021.Legacy Auto Insurance Transfer\nOn September\n 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement(the\n \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James  River effective  July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurancerisks\n relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in theamount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to\n the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risktransfer\n arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator forongoing\n handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021,and\n adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidatedstatement of operat\nions consisting of the difference between83\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
