The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas\n switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We app\nealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme  Court of the UK upheld the tribunal  ruling. Subsequently, we initiated  a historical  claims  settlement  process for UKdrivers. Damages may includ\ne back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act\nion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou\nnced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith\n Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa\nctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme\nntation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed\n that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions\n unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib\nle drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our\n portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d\nrivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We\n are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl\naimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands \ncourt ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,\n as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould\n incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum\n wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.\n Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and\n we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.  Any  of  these  events  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  result  ofoperations, financial pos\nition, and cash flows.For\n a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operatingcondition\n and  cash  flows,  see  the  risk  factor  titled  \u201c-Our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if  Drivers  were  classified  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees\u201d\n included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in PartII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial St\natements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\n addition,  if  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  this  may  impact  our  current  financial  statement  presentation  including  revenue,  cost  ofrevenue,\n incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to theconsolidated\n financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  \u201cFinancial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,\u201d  and  the  section  titled  \u201cCritical  AccountingEstimates\u201d in Part II, \nItem 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.50\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
