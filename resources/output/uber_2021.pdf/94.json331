The  service-based  condition  for  these  awards  generally  is  satisfied  over  four  years.  The  performance-basedconditions\n generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-based awards. The market-bas\ned conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.For\n market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions includingexpected\n stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate thevolatility\n of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in itsindustry group.\n We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect atthe\n time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock andestimated the expected capital raise\n percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.We\n record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over therequisite\n service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparingthe\n derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisiteservice period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)\nWe recognize stock-bas\ned expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides fortwelve-month\n offering  periods,  and  each  offering  period  includes  two  purchase  periods  of  approximately  six  months.  The  ESPP  allows  eligible  employees  topurchase\n shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimatethe\n fair  value  of  shares  to  be  issued  under  the  ESPP  based  on  a  combination  of  options  valued using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  In  2019,  wedetermine\n volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility andour\n peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimatethe expected term based o\nn the contractual term.Common Stock Fair Value\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair va\nlue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.Prior\n to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensivebusiness,\n finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculatingstock-based\n compensation  expense.  We  obtained  contemporaneous  third-party  valuations  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in  determining  fair  value.  Thesecontemporaneous\n third-party  valuations  used  the  methodologies,  approaches  and  assumptions  consistent  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  PublicAccountants Practice Guide, \nValuation of Privately-Held -Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Income Taxes\nWe\n account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected futuretax consequences of events th\nat have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.We\n account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax positionwhen\n it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. Income tax\n positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.We\n recognize  accrued  interest  and  penalties  related  to  unrecognized  tax  benefits  in  the  provision  for  (benefit  from)  income  taxes  in  the  consolidatedstatements of operations.\nValuation\n allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized basedon the\n weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of theappropriate\n character  (for  example,  ordinary  income  or  capital  gain)  within  the  carryback  or  carryforward  periods  available  under  the  applicable  tax  law.  Weregularly\n review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversalsof existing\n temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future marketconditions\n and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets, our income tax provis\nion would increase or decrease in the period in92\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
