Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, atleast in the near term.\nIf\n we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become \nless appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.Our\n success  in  a  given  geographic  market  significantly  depends  on  our  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  our  network  scale  and  liquidity  in  that  geographicmarket\n by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect\n to offer them through a competitor\u2019s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We haveexperienced and expect \nto continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate, and such supply constraints have beenand may continue to\n be impacted by concerns regarding the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a givenmarket,\n we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that weexperience in that\n market. Similarly, if carriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficientsupply\n of carriers in specific geographic markets to attract shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific\n geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay\n lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill\n become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurantgroups\n and  other  merchants,  and  this  concentration  increases  the  risk  of  fluctuations  in  our  operating  results  and  our  sensitivity  to  any  material  adversedevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners.\n If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lacksufficient\n opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of ourplatform.\n An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we maybenefit\n from having larger network scale and liquidity than some competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcomeby\n smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may bemore\n important  to service  quality than the absolute size of the network. If our service  quality diminishes  or our competitors\u2019  products achieve  greater  marketadoption, our competitors m\nay be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network effect.Our\n number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operationof\n our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Driversand\n merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,including\n as  a result  of safety  incidents  and  corporate  reporting  related  to  safety,  perceived  political  or  geopolitical  affiliations,  a pandemic  or an  outbreak  ofdisease or similar public health concern, such as the current CO\nVID-19 pandemic, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has notfundamentally\n changed,  dissatisfaction  with  changes  we  make  to  our  products  and  offerings,  or  dissatisfaction  with  our  products  and  offerings  in  general.  Inaddition,\n if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner,\n our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish ormaintain\n active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-qualitysupport,\n or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and ourbusiness would suffer.\nThe\n number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide theirservices\n through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms orservices,\n and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or otheraspects\n of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork,\n we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial p\nerformance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often,\n we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likelybe\n viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches,\n including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  andmerchants,\n which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  ourautonomous\n vehicle  strategy,  which  may  add  to  Driver  dissatisfaction  over  time,  as  it  may  reduce  the  need  for  Drivers.  Driver  dissatisfaction  has  in  the  pastresulted\n in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protestsmay\n result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce ournetwork liquidity, and which in turn \nmay cause a further decline in platform usage.17\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
