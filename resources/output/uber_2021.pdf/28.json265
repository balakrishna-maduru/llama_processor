If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit\nion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc\nluding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our\n performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition\ns, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,\n taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives\n during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone\n of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation\n alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand\n may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants\n in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene\nrally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany\n of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand\n offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni\nties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf\nlation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors\n such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle\n parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,\n factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant\n operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the\n control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek\n alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause\n order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson\n our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and oper\nating results.If\n we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee da\nta, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We\n collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers\n and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are anattractive\n target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,alteration or\n destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation andbrand,\n a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwiseprocess\n some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,acquisition, disclosure, a\nlteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.Because\n the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizableuntil\n launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may bevulnerable\n to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measuresmay\n misappropriate  confidential,  proprietary,  or  personal  information  held  by  or  on  behalf  of  us,  disrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  computers,  or  otherwisedamage\n our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,including potential li\nability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.Security\n breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmentalinvestigation.\n We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in May 2014, we experienced a datasecurity\n incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that anemployee had unintentiona\nlly posted publicly on a26\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
