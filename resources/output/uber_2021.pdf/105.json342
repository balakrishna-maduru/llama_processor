In  exchange  for  consideration  contributed,  wereceived\n a seat on MLU B.V.\u2019s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner\nship interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise\n significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of De\ncember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020\nDuring\n 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest. The contribution ofDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilut\nion of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%. The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto\n our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous\n driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (\u201cSDG\u201d), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of ourownership interest to 20% in SDG, initi\nally valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.2021\nOn\n August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and wewould\n sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the \u201cInitial Closing\u201d). Subsequent to the Initial Closing,Yandex\n spun-off,  by  way  of  demerger  from  MLU  B.V.,  its  delivery  businesses:  Yandex.Eats,  Yandex.Lavka  and  Yandex.Delivery  (collectively,  \u201cDemergedBusinesses\u201d).\n Immediately  following  the  demerger,  Yandex  acquired  all  of  our  equity  interest  in  the  Demerged  Businesses  (\u201cDemerger  Share  Closing\u201d).  Inconnection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an\n option (\u201cMLU B.V. Call Option\u201d) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. duringthe\n two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction was $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i)$276\n million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLUB.V. Call Option; and (iv) the rema\nining immaterial amounts to our interest in SDG.Initial Closing\nDuring\n the third quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG and 4.5% of equityinterest\n in MLU B.V. to Yandex. At the initial closing, we derecognized 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. and recognized a gain of $106 million in otherincome (expense), net on our \nconsolidated statement of operations.
