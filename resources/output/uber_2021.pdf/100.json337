Level  1  instrument  valuations  are  based  on  quoted  market  prices  of  the  identicalunderlying\n security.

Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniquesdue to the absence of quoted m\narket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.Our\n Level  3  non-marketable  debt  securities  and  non-marketable  equity  securities  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021  primarily  consist  of  common  stockinvestments and redeemable \npreferred stock investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.Depending\n on  the  investee\u2019s  financing  activity  in  a  reporting  period,  management\u2019s  estimate  of  fair  value  may  be  primarily  derived  from  the  investee\u2019sfinancing\n transactions,  such  as  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  to  new  investors.  The  price  in  these  transactions  generally  provides  the  best  indication  of  theenterprise\n value of the investee.
