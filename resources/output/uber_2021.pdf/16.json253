We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\ntion.Changes\n to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\n by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\n for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminar\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\n self-employed).  Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, goingforward.\n Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relatio\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCriticalAccounting\n Estimates\u201d  included  in  Part II,  Item  7  of this  Annual  Report on  Form  10-K and  Note  1 in  the  section  titled  \u201cNotes  to  the Consolidated  FinancialStatements\u201d included in Pa\nrt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
