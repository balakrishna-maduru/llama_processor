Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur\nes may deteriorate.Critical Audit Matters\nThe\n critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor\n required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii)\n involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility \nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\n and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\n to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss developmentpatterns\n and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  bymanagement\n and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new  information  becomes  known.  The  Company\u2019s  short-term  and  long-term  insurance  reserves  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 bil\nlion.The\n principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  valuation  of  insurance  reserves  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  thesignificant\n judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivityand\n effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  the  actuarial  methods  and  management\u2019s  significant  assumptions  related  to  lossdevelopment patterns and \nexpected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over thedevelopment\n of  the  significant  assumptions  related  to  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs.  These  procedures  also  included,  among  others,  theinvolvement of professiona\nls with specialized skill72\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
