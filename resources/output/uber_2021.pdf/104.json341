Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair valueof these securities based\n on valuation methods, including the common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securitiesissued by the investee adjust\ned for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.The\n following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income(expense),\n net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during theyears\n ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 based on the observable price in an orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (inmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019\n2020 2021 Upward adjustments\n$ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 71 Downward adjustments (including imp\nairment)\u2014 (1,690) \u2014 Total unrealized gain \n(loss) for non-marketable equity securities$ \u2014 $ (1,690) $ 71 We\n evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potentialimpairment\n indicators.  This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,\n significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\ning value.To\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\n within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\n valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\ne OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm\nent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020. There wasno remeasurement even\nt for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.The following table summar\nizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:Fair value method\nKey unobservable input CSE\nMarket adjustment (20)% OPM\nVolatility 39% Estimated time to liquidity\n2.0 years Market adjustment\n(40)% During\n the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction. In addition, werecorded\n unrealized gains of $71 million from remeasurement of the carrying value of the remaining Didi shares under the measurement alternative during thethree months ended March 31, 2021.\nWe\n did not record any realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years endedDecember 31, 2019 and 2020.\n102\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
