Furthermore, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally for approximatelyone year, and our shared rides o\nffering continues to be temporarily suspended in many regions.Furthermore,\n as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked that all employees who are able to do so work remotely, and while we have since re-openedcertain\n offices and announced a hybrid return-to-office plan for employees, plans to return to the office may be negatively impacted by ongoing spread of theCOVID-19\n virus, including positive tests for COVID-19 among some personnel who voluntarily returned to the office; these and any future instances of positiveCOVID-19\n tests of personnel working in our offices, as well as continued widespread remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on our operations,the\n execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-partyservice\n providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by theoutbreak\n and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees\u2019 ability towork\n remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote workingmay also\n result in privacy, cybersecurity and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance fromregulatory\n authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves inresponse to future developm\nents.We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by launchi\nng new, or expanding existing, services, features, or health and safety requirements on an expeditedbasis,\n particularly those relating to delivery of food and other goods. Our understanding of applicable privacy, consumer protection and other legal and regulatoryrequirements,\n as  well  as  the  latest  guidance  from  regulatory  authorities  in  connection  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  may  be  subject  to  legal  or  regulatorychallenge, particularly\n as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features,or\n health  and  safety  requirements  in  response  to  COVID-19  may  heighten  other  risks  described  in  this  \u201cRisk  Factors\u201d  section,  including  our  classification  ofDrivers. These challenges cou\nld result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.The\n COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand\n may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof\n our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot\n believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.\n The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of th\ne outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration,\n adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains,\n foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users\u2019\n behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.  Moreover,  even  after  shelter  at  home  orders  and  travel  advisories  are  lifted,demand\n for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels.\nIn\n addition, we cannot predict  the impact  the COVID-19 pandemic  will have on our business partners  and third-party  vendors, and we may be adverselyimpacted as\n a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic\n have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets.\n To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the otherrisks\n described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our busin\ness, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.Operational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Driv\ners were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.The\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\n or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.  We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other\n things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to per\nform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with\n defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may con\ntinue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drive\nrs in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
