We elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions\n about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we a\nccount for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\nWe\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\n which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (\u201cROU\u201d)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\n to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.\nOperating\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\n sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized\n as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operat\ning lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.Acquisitions\nWe\n account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d). Thepurchase\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\n date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof\n the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida\nted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill\nGoodwill\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected\n to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances\n indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair\n value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents\n or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, afterassessing\n the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai\nrment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The\n quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be i\nmpaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss\n will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 \u2013 Goodwill andIntangible Assets for furth\ner information.Intangible Assets, Net\nIntangible\n assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one  to 18 years. We reviewdefinite-lived\n intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section.
