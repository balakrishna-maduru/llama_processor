If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely i\nmpacted.Our\n platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly\n fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada\n from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto\n entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift\n to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants\n have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and car\nriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further,\n while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan\n we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.\n In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers\n value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competitioncould\n result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.\nWe face competit\nion in each of our offerings, including:\u2022\nMobility .  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets\n that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition,\n public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany\n cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi jo\nint venture.\u2022\nDelivery .  Our Delivery offering competes  with numerous companies  in the meal, grocery and other delivery  space in various regions for Drivers,consumers,\n and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.Our\n Delivery  offering  also  competes  with  restaurants,  including  those  that  offer  their  own  delivery  and/or  take-away,  meal  kit  delivery  services,grocery delivery services,\n and traditional grocers.\u2022\nFreight.  Our  Freight  offering  competes  with  global  and  North  American  freight  brokers  such  as  C.H.  Robinson,  Total  Quality  Logistics,  XPOLogistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Tr\nansfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.Many\n of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products andofferings, and alterna\ntive pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitorshave, and\n may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographicmarket.\n In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operatinghistories,\n larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respondmore\n quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which mayrender\n our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals andlitigation victori\nes we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.We\n are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China throughAugust\n 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests in Grab, India withrespect\n to meal delivery through January 2023, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters\n through May 2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competeswith us\n in certain countries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europeand\n Africa. As Didi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographicmarkets.
