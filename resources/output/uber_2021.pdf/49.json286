The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod\n 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim\n alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain\n taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and in\ntend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal Proceedings\nWhile\n it is not possible to determine  the outcome  of the legal  actions,  investigations,  and proceedings  brought against  us, we believe  that,  except for thematters\n described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial\n to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.  We  are  currently  involved  in,  and  may  in  the  future  be  involved  in,  legalproceedings,\n litigation,  claims,  and  government  investigations  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  addition,  the  nature  of  our  business  exposes  us  to  claimsrelated\n to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates\n where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations\n in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial\n adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment\n investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and inte\nrim rulings.ITEM 4.
