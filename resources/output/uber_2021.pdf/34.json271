Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business,financial condition, or op\nerating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.Financing and Transactional Risks\nWe will require additional capital \nto support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.To\n continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings,and markets. If we raise \nadditional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,and\n any  new  equity  securities  we  issue  may  have  rights,  preferences,  and  privileges  superior  to  those  of  existing  stockholders.  Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments\n contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother\n financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, ourexisting\n debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financingon\n favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business ch\nallenges and competition may be significantly limited.We\n have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the ter\nms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As\n of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $238 million ofCareem\n Convertible  Notes  remain  subject  to  future  issuance  to  Careem  stockholders  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Subject  to  the  limitations  in  the  terms  of  ourexisting and future indebt\nedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may needto incur additional debt \nto finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.We\n may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments willreduce\n the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing forworking\n capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability\n to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe\n industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow\n from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or\n to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating ac\ntivities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.In\n addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including\n limitations  on  incurring  additional  indebtedness  and  liens,  limitations  on  certain  consolidations,  mergers,  and  sales  of  assets,  and  restrictions  on  thepayment\n of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raisingactivities\n and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain  additional  capital  to  pursue  business  opportunities,including\n potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit ourability to obtain addit\nional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.In addition, we are exposed to\n interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled \u201cManagement'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condit\nion and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.\u201dWe may have exposure to materiall\ny greater than anticipated tax liabilities.The\n tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, wemay\n become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many othermultinational\n corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate.Currently,\n certain  jurisdictions  are  investigating  our  compliance  with  tax  rules.  If  it  is  determined  that  we  are  not  compliant  with  such  rules,  we  could  oweadditional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia,\n Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowedto\n contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those mattersare being litigated. This prepayment of\n contested taxes is referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subjectto such taxes; even when such paymen\nts32\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
