As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized again of $242 million in other \nincome (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.MLU B.V. Call Option\nThe\n MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured\n at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise\n price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember\n 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe\n year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple\n scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 y\nears, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded\n in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare\n of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and\n amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments represent\ning fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the co\nmposition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021\nEquity method goodwill\n$ 545 Intangible assets, net \nof accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities\n(12) Cumulative currency tr\nanslation adjustments(107) Basis difference\n$ 480 We\n amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line\n method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod\n goodwill is not amortized. The investment balance  is reviewed for impairment  whenever factors indicate  that the carrying value of the equity methodinvestment\n may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The futureeffect of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand related government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.Mission Bay 3 & 4\nThe\n Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (\u201cECOP\u201d), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies(\u201cLLC\n Partners\u201d) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 millioncash\n in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% asof December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nIn\n March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off theexisting construction\n loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining  proceeds were distributed back toUber\n and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, andreduced the investment \ncarrying value by the same amount.We\n have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter inarrears,\n we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP\u2019s income or loss, and any impairments, with a correspondingcredit\n or  debit,  respectively,  to  income  or  loss  from  equity  method  investment,  net  of  tax  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  2019,  theconstruction\n was completed and leasing activities commenced. and immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized during 2019, 2020 and 2021. During2020 and\n 2021, we incurred an immaterial amount of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined thatthere was no impairment o\nf our investment in ECOP.104\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
