To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need thro\nugh employee engagement surveysand\n related  tools. We historically  conducted a semi-annual  workforce  survey that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and well-being.  But in2021,\n we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results ofthese regular checks to\n better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth\n opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased\n on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metri\ncs such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee\n Development  and  Retention.  We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to d\nrive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough\n internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem\n to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness\n and  productivity.  This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life\u2019s  expected  and  unexpected  events.  Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefitspackages to our employees and \ntheir families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.For\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, futureattrition,\n or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our2021 People and Culture Report, which is ava\nilable on our website.

We  encouragedifferent\n opinions  and  approaches  to  be  heard,  and  then  we  come  together  and  build.  We  believe  that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment\n that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implementprocesses\n throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people\n with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically \nunderrepresented groups.Our\n Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior ex\necutives.We\n encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline.\nAs\n a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To dothat,\n we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.In\n July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.Some of our commitments to \nanti-racism include:\u2022\nRidding our platform of racism\u2022\nFighting racism with technology\u2022\nSustaining equity and belonging for all\u2022\nDriving equity in the communityFor\n more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which areavailable on our website.
