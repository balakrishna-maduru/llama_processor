We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the fo\nreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform wi\nll become less appealing to platform users.\u2022\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.

These  new  ventures  areinherently risky, and we may nev\ner realize any expected benefits from them.\u2022\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected byeconomic, social, weathe\nr, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances, including COVID-19.11\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}
