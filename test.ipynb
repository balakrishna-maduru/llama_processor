Business.\\nOur Mission\\nImprove people’s lives with \\nthe world’s best transportation.Overview\\nLyft,\\n Inc  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing\\n and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.\\nWe\\n believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal\\n change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “Lyft App”) in cities across the United States and in selectcities\\n in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing\\n our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to i\\nmprove the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We\\n are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the“Lyft\\n Platform”)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant\\n number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit \\nfrom technological innovation in mobility.Today,\\n our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”)for\\n shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fix\\ned period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We\\n generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers\\n for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders\\n renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing\\n marketplace available to organizations through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs. In the secondquarter of 2021, we began genera\\nting revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We\\n have made focused and substantial  investments  in support of our mission. For example,  to continually  launch new innovations on our platform,  we haveinvested\\n heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a diffe\\nrentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platfor\\nm and scaled user network.Notwithstanding\\n the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso\\n continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology\\n on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a le\\nader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim\\n to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We\\n believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.  Through  our  LyftUpinitiative,\\n we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We arealso\\n proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft network by the end of 2030.We believe many users a\\nre loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility.Our\\n values, brand and focus on customer experience are key differentiators for our business. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing services,including\\n a transportation network, based on brand affinity and value alignment. As we progress through the COVID-19 recovery, we remain confident the demand for ourofferings will continue to g\\nrow as more and more people discover and rely on the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.5\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\\nAlthough\\n we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the\\n impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto\\n be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich\\n may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor\\n recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe\\n office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consu\\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\\ne presently estimated.In\\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\\nFor\\n more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I.

We  have a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for optionsthat\\n are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile andlast-mile of a multimodal trip \\nwith public transit.•\\nPublic  Transit. Available  in  select  cities,  our  Transit  offering  integrates  third-party  public  transit  data  into  the  Lyft  App  to  offer  users  a  robust  view  oftransportation\\n options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is anotherstep toward providing effec\\ntive, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.•\\nLyft Autonomous. We  have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerlyAptiv)\\n has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-elementtransaction\\n with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5,as\\n well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  and  commercialization of  the  automated-drivingvehicles\\n that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on ashared commitment to d\\neploy Ford’s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.We have established one of \\nthe largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportationhappens locally and each m\\narket has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.Drivers\\nThe\\n drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We workhard\\n to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what mattersmost. Key benefits to drivers on ou\\nr platform include:•\\nFlexibility. We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.•\\nTechnology. Our  predictive  technology  around  ride  volume  and  demand  enables  us  to  share  key  information  with  drivers  about  when  and  where  to  drive  tomaximize their earnings on a\\n real-time basis.•\\nInsurance. We  procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents whileon the platform.\\n•\\nCommunity Standards. To help us uphold high  community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked throughthe Lyft App.\\n•\\nSupport. Our  Driver  Hubs  and  certain  field  locations  in  major  cities  serve  as  gathering  places  and  offer  in-person  support  and  a  personal  connection  to  Lyftemployees. In addition, driv\\ners have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.Riders\\nRiders are\\n as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work,explore\\n their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. Unless otherwise stated, riders are passengers whorequest\\n rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile. We work hard to provide riders with a quality experienceevery time they open the Ly\\nft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice.

Our key growth strategies include our plans to:•\\nIncrease Rider Use Cases. We  are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offerproducts to\\n simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity\\n safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transport\\nation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.•\\nGrow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our\\n brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto\\n try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting\\n and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork\\n coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population \\nthat is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.•\\nGrow Our Share of Consumers’ Transportation Spend. Lyft’s  transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft networkspans\\n rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic exper\\nience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.•\\nDeliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities. For example, throu\\ngh our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We’ve also been investing in ourDriver\\n Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driverexperience better \\nand better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft’s network.•\\nInvest in our Marketplace Technology. Our  investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers andriders.\\n Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to making our network more efficientand seamless to use.\\n•\\nThoughtfully Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshar e Holdings LLC (“Motivate”), the largest bike sharing platform inthe\\n United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continueto\\n selectively  consider acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities  to ournetwork.\\n We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We havealso\\n built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursuepartnerships that contr\\nibute to our growth.Competition\\nThe\\n market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices and offerings.

We attract new drivers and riders through referrals, partnerships,display advertising,\\n radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization, keyword search campaigns, and more. We continue to engage with current riders througha variety of initia\\ntives, including emails, in-app notifications, social media content, promotions, and more.Our Commitment to Safety\\nA\\n strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers andriders on our platform, and we \\ntake significant measures every day that are focused on their safety.To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding hig\\nh quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerlyknown\\n as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. With over 300 employees as of December 31, 2021, SCC is in charge of fielding safetyand\\n customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. Our SCC team focuseson driving results based on exper\\nience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets resolved during first contact with a driver orrider, and\\n Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders.

Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.•\\nOngoing criminal  monitoring.  Continuous criminal  monitoring  allows us to quickly deactivate  drivers with disqualifying  criminal  convictions.  We also checkdriving records throughout the y\\near to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.•\\nMandatory safety education.  Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These\\n programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and \\nreporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.•\\nEmergency help, supported by ADT.

Drivers are also not ableto see a rider’s drop-of\\nf location, whether it’s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.•\\nTwo-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider ordriver\\n who submits a rating of four stars or fewer is prompted to provide more details. Anyone who rates a rider or driver three stars or fewer will never bematched with that individu\\nal again through the app.In 2021,\\n we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which ar\\ne statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips\\n in this period.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately\\n 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineer\\ning, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.We\\n believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees\\n reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male\\n and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8%\\n Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon\\n self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees\\n who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.\\nWe\\n strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent\\n internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone\\n Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe \\nrecruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of\\n the most powerful examples of Lyft’s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive yea\\nr to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers’\\n annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.  The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent\\n demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors\\n not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate b\\nusiness factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty \\nand as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are rep\\nresented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.In\\n December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report since2017 and intend to continue to pres\\nent this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance\\nIn\\n May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website. We began publishing this reportin 2020 and intend to continue to pr\\nepare this report annually to make available key information about our work toward environmental, social, and economic issues.Environmental\\nLyft\\n was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. Our vision is to rebuildcities\\n around people by offering seamless access through the Lyft App to on-demand rides, public transit, and car rentals as well as lower-carbon micromobility modes. Asanother\\n step in the shift from personal car ownership, we’ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition \\nto perks for car rentals.We\\n launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople\\n as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a “resilient street corridor” might look like in cities where Lyftoperates\\n micromobility  services.  It  also  investigated  the  impact  of  street  design  on  key  metrics  around  vehicle  miles  traveled,  socioeconomic  demographics  and  GHGemissions.\\n12\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to enable access to affordable,reliable\\n transportation for all — no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding\\n transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, b\\nike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:•\\nJobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;•\\nGrocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;•\\nCommunity Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;•\\nMicromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\\n•\\nUniversal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\\n•\\nDisaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\\n•\\nVoting Access - provides rides to the polls du ring Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and commun\\nities of color.In\\n response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (“SB8”) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver\\n Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure\\n that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or sh\\nare where they are going or why.Corporate Governance\\nOur\\n board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe\\n utmost business integrity.

The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue tocause,\\n decreased  demand  for  our  platform  relative  to pre-COVID-19  demand,  disruptions  in  global  supply chains,  and  significant  volatility  and disruption  of  financialmarkets.\\nThe\\n COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, thosediscussed below:\\n•\\nDeclines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platformwhich\\n has decreased our revenues. These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Wepaused our\\n shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021. While certain typesof\\n travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  andbehavior\\n arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to thisadverse effect.\\n•\\nChanges in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certainmarkets.\\n This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted\\n and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\\nation.•\\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations\\n to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.

Tothe\\n extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maint\\nain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.•\\nWe design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles\\n that meet our standards is critical to our operations. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared LightVehicles\\n and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services. We have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemicrelated\\n to  these  assets,  such  as  delays  in  their  manufacture  and  delivery  and  increased  costs  associated  with  manufacturing  and  shipping,  and  we  may  faceadditional\\n challenges in future periods. These challenges may adversely affect our ability to deploy new Light Vehicles on our network or to implement newfeatures\\n on our network of Light Vehicles. These supply chain issues have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.\\n•\\nThe impacts of COVID-19 have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for vehicles rented to drivers through our Express Drive program,and\\n for the fleet rented to users through Lyft Rentals. Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft’s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough\\n the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto\\n COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while ExpressDrive\\n rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit\\n the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These\\n operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure\\n to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad\\n and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities\\n most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed.

As the severity, magnitude and durationof\\n the COVID-19 pandemic, the public health responses, and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic’simpact\\n on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, remainsuncertain\\n and difficult to predict. As the pandemic continues, the recovery of the economy and our business have fluctuated and varied by geography. Further, theultimate\\n impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that arenot\\n within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to thepandemic\\n (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto onlocal\\n or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;evolving\\n laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key marketsand financial market volatility;\\n volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent ofany virus mutations or new stra\\nins of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.•\\nIn light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results.\\nOur business could be adversely affected by natural d\\nisasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.A significant\\n natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, theInternet\\n or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known forseismic\\n activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,other\\n epidemics, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political or social instability and other geopolitical developments, or other catastrophic events,whether\\n in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine\\n that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or ourthird-party\\n providers’ abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and \\nresults of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.A deterioration of general macroeconomi\\nc conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and\\n results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders. A deterioration ofgeneral\\n macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slower  growth  or  recession,  inflation,  changes  to  fuel  and  other  energy  costs  or  vehicle  costs,  or  decreases  in  consumerspending\\n power or confidence may harm our results of operations. Economic  weakness or uncertainty, and constrained consumer spending have in the past resulted in, andmay\\n in the future result in, decreased revenues and earnings. Such factors could make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negativelyaffect\\n our ability to make decisions about future investments. In addition, economic instability or uncertainty, and other events beyond our control, such as the COVID-19pandemic,\\n have, and may continue to, put pressure  on economic  conditions, which has led and could lead,  to reduced  demand for services  on our platform  or greateroperating\\n expenses. For  example,  inflation  has  broadly  impacted  the  auto  service  industry,  which  has  increased  our  insurance  costs.  If  general  economic  conditionsdeteriorate\\n in  the  United  States  or  in  other  markets  where  we  operate,  discretionary  spending  may  decline  and  demand  for  ridesharing  may  be  reduced.

Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluatethe\\n markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of su\\nch evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If\\n we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.\\nOur\\n continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease\\n utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.  To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided\\n access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our plat\\nform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or\\n superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour\\n requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof\\n our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,during\\n the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand\\n visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased\\n incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable\\n to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers\\n may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour\\n expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Thisincludes\\n a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal \\nwith Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe\\n required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment\\n model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risksrelating\\n to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.\\nIf\\n drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria\\n and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected.

In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related r\\nisk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with athird-party\\n financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as ofDecember\\n 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.

In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolvingofferings, and\\n we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsuranceproviders\\n becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. Certain losses may be excluded from insurance coverage including, butnot limited to losses caus\\ned by intentional act, pollution, contamination, virus, bacteria, terrorism, war and civil unrest.The\\n amount of one or more auto-related claims or operations-related claims has exceeded and could continue to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits,for\\n which we have borne and could continue to bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions or otherwisepaid\\n by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many types of claims, coverages and for a variety of commercial risks andare\\n likely to do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when ourpolicies\\n are renewed or replaced to manage pricing pressure.

For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses forclaims\\n and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determinethat\\n our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to ournet\\n loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Any of the foregoing risks couldadversely affect our bus\\niness, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our abil\\nity to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand\\n for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors,\\n including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect\\n our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof\\n offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes\\n the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade\\n pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition,\\n regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers\\n on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders\\n on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively\\n in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand\\n regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding\\n minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle. We havetested\\n or launched, and expect to in the future test or launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription packages and driver or rider loyalty programs. Wehave also modified,\\n and expect to in the future modify, existing pricing methodologies, such as our up-front pricing policy. Any of the foregoing actions may not ultimatelybe successful in attra\\ncting and retaining qualified drivers and riders or may result in negative public perception and harm to our reputation.While\\n we continue to maintain that drivers on our platform are independent contractors in legal and administrative proceedings, our arguments may ultimately beunsuccessful. A\\n determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform\\n as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opp\\nortunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional\\n costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in\\n the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified\\n drivers. Moreover, successful  litigation to overturn Proposition 22, or the reclassification  of drivers on our platform  as employees  could reduce the availablesupply\\n of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance\\n supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing\\n or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue tolaunch\\n new  and  develop  existing  asset-intensive  offerings  such  as  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  Driver  Hubs,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,Express\\n Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect ourpricing\\n methodologies.

For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike’s exclusivity,arguing\\n that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco’s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco\\n continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A\\n negative determination in other legal disputes regarding bike and scooter sharing, including an adverse determination regarding our existing rights to operate, couldadversely\\n affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating\\n due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals\\n of bikes and scooters from March through October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  and again suspended rentals  of scooters from December  2020through February 2021 an\\nd for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual\\n region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are ableto\\n successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe\\n negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased\\n number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or inciden\\nts involving our competitors’ offerings.We design and\\n contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand\\n scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will beable\\n to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all.

In the event that our supply of bikes andscooters or\\n key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in business conditio\\nns, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond ourcontrol have affect\\ned and could continue to affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.We incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing an\\nd operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costsas\\n we expand our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our controlincluding\\n market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand. Substantial increases in prices of these assets or the cost of ouroperations\\n would increase our costs and reduce our margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, customsauthorities\\n may challenge or disagree with our classification, valuation or country of origin determinations of our imports. Such challenges could result in tariff liabilities,including tariffs\\n on past imports, as well as penalties and interest. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible tariff liabilities in our financial statements,if these liabilit\\nies exceed such reserves, our financial condition could be harmed.Our\\n bikes  and  scooters  or  components  thereof,  including  bikes  and  scooters  and  components  that  we  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  using  third-partysuppliers,\\n have  experienced  and  may  in  the  future  experience  quality  problems,  product  issues  or  acts  of  vandalism  or  theft  from  time  to  time,  which  could  result  indecreased\\n usage of our network of Light Vehicles or loss of our bikes or scooters.

Following the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, weno\\n longer develop our own autonomous vehicle technology, so we must develop and maintain partnerships with other companies to offer autonomous vehicle technologyon\\n our platforms, and if we are unable to do so, or if we do so at a slower pace or at a higher cost or if our technology is less capable relative to our competitors, or if ourefforts\\n to  optimize  our  strategy  with  regard  to  our  autonomous  vehicle  technology  development  are  not  successful,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations could be adverse\\nly affected.The\\n autonomous vehicle industry may not continue to develop, or autonomous vehicles may not be adopted by the market, which could adversely affect our prospects,business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe\\n have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in the development of autonomous vehicle-related technology for use on our platform. Autonomous drivinginvolves\\n a complex set of technologies, including the continued development of sensing, computing and control technology. We have relied both on our own research anddevelopment\\n and on strategic partnerships with third-party developers of such technologies, as such technologies are costly and in varying stages of maturity. There is noassurance\\n that this research and development or these partnerships will result in the development of market-viable technologies or commercial success in a timely manneror\\n at all and as a result of the sale of our Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, we are more reliant on partnerships for this development. In order to gain acceptance, thereliability of autono\\nmous vehicle technology must continue to advance.Additional challenges to th\\ne development and deployment of autonomous vehicle technology, all of which are outside of our control, include:•\\nmarket acceptance of autonomous vehicles;•\\nstate, federal or municipal licensing requirements, safety standards, and other regulatory measures;•\\nnecessary changes to infrastructure to enable adoption;•\\nconcerns regarding electronic security and privacy; and•\\npublic perception regarding the safety of autonomous vehicles for drivers, riders, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road.There\\n are  a  number  of  existing  laws,  regulations  and  standards  that  may  apply  to  autonomous  vehicle  technology,  including  vehicle  standards  that  were  notoriginally\\n intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly evolve, which may increase the likelihood of complex,conflicting\\n or otherwise inconsistent regulations, which may delay our ability to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market or significantly increase the compliancecosts\\n associated with this business strategy. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market will accept autonomous vehicles or the timing of such acceptance, if atall, and even if it does, that we will be able to execute on our busine\\nss strategy or that our offerings will be successful in the market.

Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand and mayadversely affect th\\ne usage of our offerings.Our commercial agreement with AWS will\\n remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after January31,\\n 2026, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or forfailure\\n to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminatedor\\n we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, newcloud\\n infrastructure service providers. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, leadto\\n a  significant  short  term  loss  of  revenue,  increase  our  costs  and  impair  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  any  of  which  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financialcondition and results of oper\\nations.On\\n February 1, 2022 we entered into an addendum to our commercial agreement with AWS, pursuant to which we committed to spend an aggregate of at least$350 million\\n between February 2022 and January 2026 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the four years. If we fail to meet the minimumpurchase commitment du\\nring any year, we may be required to pay the difference, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  for  our  Express  Drive  program  and  Lyft  Rentals  program,  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleetmanagement\\n and finance partners to support our Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals program, and if we cannot manage our relationships with such parties andother risks related to our Express Drive and Lyft Rentals program, our business, f\\ninancial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\\n rely  on  third-party  and  affiliate  vehicle  rental  partners  as  well  as  third-party  vehicle  supply,  fleet  management  and  finance  partners  to  supply  vehicles  todrivers\\n for our Express Drive program. If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates itsrelationship\\n with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  beadversely\\n impacted, and we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame.Similarly,\\n in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result ofpublic\\n health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners’  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  becomeconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall\\n affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft’s rentalpartners.\\n In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannotfind\\n alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners’ fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able tomeet\\n the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to anumber\\n of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost fromour\\n Express  Drive  program  compared  to  the  corresponding  cost  from  the  rest  of  our  ridesharing  marketplace  offerings.

Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affectour business, financial condi\\ntion and results of operations.Our\\n Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residualvalue related to the used car market \\nvalues, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.For\\n the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  ourExpress\\n Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment\\n to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat\\n any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements,\\n despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or\\n Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises\\n such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles\\n in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has in\\ncreased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The\\n costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party\\n resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue\\n of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveaffected\\n the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, arereportedly\\n seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and  corresponding  residual  value  of  used  vehicles.  Areduction in\\n residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require usto depreciate\\n those vehicles at a more accelerated rate. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if we are unable to accurately forecastthe residual values of veh\\nicles in the fleets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\\n rely  on  third-party  payment  processors  to  process  payments  made  by  riders  and  payments  made  to  drivers  on  our  platform,  and  if  we  cannot  manage  ourrelationships with such third parties and other payment-rela\\nted risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We\\n rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform. If any of ourthird-party\\n payment processors terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to find analternate\\n payment processor, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and servicesprovided\\n by our third-party payment processors may not meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised or experience outages. Any of these riskscould\\n cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to drivers on our platform, any of which could makeour platform less conve\\nnient and attractive to users and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.Nearly\\n all rider payments and driver payouts are made by credit card, debit card or through third-party payment services, which subjects us to certain paymentnetwork\\n or service provider operating rules, to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options to riders that may be subject toadditional operating ru\\nles, regulations and risks.

As a result, we may introduce significantchanges\\n to our  existing  offerings  or develop  and  introduce  new and unproven offerings.  For example,  in April 2020,  we began piloting  a delivery  service  platform  inresponse\\n to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our  inability  to  adequately  detect  or  prevent  fraudulent  transactions  could  harm  our  reputation  or  brand,  result  in  litigation  orregulatory action and l\\nead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We\\n have  also  incurred,  and  may  in  the  future  incur,  losses  from  fraud  and  other  misuse  of  our  platform  by  drivers  and  riders,  including  in  connection  withprograms\\n we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand\\n miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our pa\\nrtner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If\\n we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely af\\nfected.Shared and\\n Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With\\n a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider’s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along\\n a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For\\n Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the\\n level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and s\\nuch fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do\\n not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared\\n or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, finan\\ncial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effecti\\nvely manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With\\n the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees\\n from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased\\n on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts pai\\nd to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we\\n take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless\\n than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.  In  addition,  riders’  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable  toeffectively\\n account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.

If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly incritical areas o\\nf our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.We\\n face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled\\n personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and may continue to intensify as the economy recovers from COVID-19. To attract and retain toptalent, we have\\n had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel oftenconsider\\n the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to providecompetitive\\n compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition. Certainof\\n our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our employees have received and may continue to receivesignificant\\n proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,  which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us.

When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012,the\\n laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since beenadopted,\\n were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharingmarketplace.\\n We  have  been  proactively  working  with  federal,  state  and  local  governments  and  regulatory  bodies  to  ensure  that  our  ridesharing  marketplace  and  otherofferings\\n are available broadly in the United States and Canada. In part due to our efforts, a large majority of U.S. states have adopted laws related to TNCs to address theunique\\n issues of the ridesharing industry. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented and interpreted inresponse to our industry and related technologies\\n. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new offerings into existing markets, regulatory bodies or courtsmay\\n claim that we or users on our platform are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting our business in certain jurisdictions, or thatusers on\\n our platform are prohibited from using our platform, either generally or with respect to certain offerings. Certain jurisdictions and governmental entities, includingairports,\\n require us to obtain permits, pay fees or comply with certain reporting and other compliance requirements to provide our ridesharing, bike and scooter sharing,auto\\n repair and collision services, Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle offerings. These jurisdictions and governmental entities may reject our applications forpermits,\\n revoke existing or deny renewals of permits to operate, delay our ability to operate, increase their fees, charge new types of fees, or impose fines and penalties,including\\n as  a  result  of  errors  in,  or  failures  to  comply  with,  reporting  or  other  requirements  related  to  our  product  offerings.  Any  of  the  foregoing  actions  by  thesejurisdictions and governmen\\ntal entities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Recent\\n financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companiesengaged\\n in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies.

These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.\\nOur industry is\\n relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States an\\nd Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For\\n example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our\\n ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The\\n City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for\\n our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich\\n we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally,\\n particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limi\\ntations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\\n success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise\\n their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand\\n employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory \\nregimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could har\\nm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classificat\\nion of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We\\n are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat\\n the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent\\n contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent\\n contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.

We  continue  to  maintain  that  drivers  on  our  platform  areindependent contractors \\nin such legal and administrative proceedings and intend to continue to defend ourself vigorously in these matters, but our arguments may ultimatelybe\\n unsuccessful.

We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative\\n actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California’s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including\\n those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors.\\n We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. See thesection titled “Lega\\nl Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.Claims by others that we infringed their proprietar\\ny technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies\\n in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights.\\n In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.\\n As we gain an increasingly  high public  profile  and the number  of competitors  in our market  increases  and as we continue to develop new technologies  andintellectual\\n property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our mark\\nets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From timeto time third parties may\\n assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” foradditional\\n information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and,\\n in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful\\n in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent\\n portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse\\n patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many\\n potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty\\n rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour\\n management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection\\n with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantialdamages,\\n royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing\\n or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, finan\\ncial condition and results of operations.With\\n respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot\\n be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. Some licenses may be non-exclusive, and thereforeour\\n competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If a third-party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on reasonable terms, or at all,we may\\n be required to develop alternative, non-infringing technology or other intellectual property, which could require significant time (during which we would be unableto\\n continue to offer our affected offerings), effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of oper\\nations.Failure to protect or enforce our intell\\nectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our\\n success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms ofinformation,\\n knowhow and technology), or intellectual property, and as we grow, we will continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing orfuture\\n business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade secret laws and contractual  restrictions  to establish andprotect\\n our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if wedo\\n detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming andexpensive and\\n could divert management attention. While we take precautions designed to protect our intellectual property, it may still be possible for competitors and otherunauthorized\\n third parties to copy our technology, reverse engineer our data and use our proprietary information to create or enhance competing solutions and services,which\\n could adversely affect our position in our rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry.

Such arrangements may limit our ability to protect, maintain, enforce or commercialize such intellectual property rights,including\\n requiring agreement with or payment to our joint development partners before protecting, maintaining, licensing or initiating enforcement of such intellectualproperty\\n rights, and may allow such joint development partners to register, maintain, enforce or license such intellectual property rights in a manner that may affect thevalue of the jointly-owned in\\ntellectual property or our ability to compete in the market.We\\n may  be  required  to  spend  significant  resources  in  order  to  monitor  and  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  and  some  violations  may  be  difficult  orimpossible to detect. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights coul\\nd be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in theimpairment\\n or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuitsattacking the\\n validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology against unauthorizedcopying or use,\\n as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductionsof\\n enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or harm our reputation or brand. In addition, we may berequired\\n to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new offerings or platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable termsor at all and could advers\\nely affect our ability to compete.Our\\n industry has also been subject to attempts to steal intellectual property, particularly regarding autonomous vehicle technology, including by foreign actors.We,\\n along with others in our industry, have been the target of attempted thefts of our intellectual property and may be subject to such attempts in the future. Although wetake\\n measures to protect our property, if we are unable to prevent the theft of our intellectual property or its exploitation, the value of our investments may be underminedand our business, financial cond\\nition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.Changes in laws or regulations relatin\\ng to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply withsuch\\n laws  and  regulations  or  any  other  obligations  relating  to  privacy,  data  protection  or  the  protection  or  transfer  of  personal  data,  could  adversely  affect  ourbusiness.\\nWe\\n receive,  transmit  and  store  a  large  volume  of  personally  identifiable  information  and  other  data  relating  to  the  users  on  our  platform.  Numerous  local,municipal, state,\\n federal and international laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certaintypes\\n of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault ofNon-Solicited\\n Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, the U.S. Federal Health InsurancePortability\\n and  Accountability  Act  of  1996,  or  HIPAA,  Section  5(c)  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  Act,  the  California  Consumer  Privacy  Act,  or  CCPA,  and  theCalifornia Privacy Rights Act,\\n or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, \\namendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA\\n will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The\\n CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain\\n unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compl\\niance-related costs and expenses.

HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain requirements regarding the use, collection, security, storage and disclosure ofindividuals’\\n protected health information, or PHI. In 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security requirementsdirectly\\n upon  business  associates  of  covered  entities.  Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  ourConcierge\\n or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclosethe\\n PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breachnotification obligations,\\n and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a “breach.” If we knowingly breach theHITECH\\n Act’s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from $100 -$50,000 per violation, with an annual \\nmaximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for “willful neglect” violations and the possibility of civil litigation.Additionally,\\n we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information securitystandards\\n and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRAimposing\\n new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, wemay\\n face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effortto\\n do so. In particular, with regard to HIPAA, we may incur increased costs as we perform our obligations to our healthcare customers under our agreements with them.

Any of these consequencescould adversely\\n affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligationsto indemnify and to incur l\\negal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.A\\n determination  in,  or  settlement  of,  any  legal  proceeding,  whether  we  are  party  to  such  legal  proceeding  or  not,  that  involves  our  industry,  could  harm  ourbusiness,\\n financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or no\\nt, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In\\n addition, we regularly include arbitration  provisions in our Terms of Service with the drivers and riders on our platform.  These provisions are intended tostreamline\\n the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,arbitration\\n may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain\\n risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand,\\n we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litiga\\ntion costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further,\\n with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw,\\n there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If ourarbitration agreements were found to be\\n unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein\\n our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our bus\\niness, financial condition and results of operations.As\\n we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand\\n regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.\\nAs\\n we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction\\n to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate oraddress the unique issues fac\\ned by our industry.For\\n example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws andregulations.\\n These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf ofhealthcare\\n partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the costsassociated\\n with  our  offerings  to  healthcare  partners.  With  respect  to  our  healthcare  rides  matched  through  the  Lyft  Platform  and  provided  to  Medicaid  or  MedicareAdvantage\\n beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws could lead to ourloss\\n of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.Further,\\n we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain riskssuch as the government’s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector’s budgetary cycles and funding aut\\nhorization, and the government’s administrative andinvestigatory processes.\\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulation\\ns and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings orplatform\\n could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party\\n providers or partners, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to our platform offerings, could harm our reputation and brand,discourage\\n new and existing drivers and riders from using our platform, lead to refunds of rider fares or result in fines or proceedings by governmental agencies or privateclaims and litigat\\nion, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We face the risk of litigat\\nion resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.The\\n actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities or claims relating to consumer protection laws.For example,\\n the TCPA restricts certain telemarketing and the use of certain automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted and may in the futureresult\\n in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving anddeveloping.\\n If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business,financial condition and \\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.45\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and proceduresand\\n internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information requiredto be disclosed\\n by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and formsand\\n that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We arealso continuing\\n to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order tomaintain and improve th\\ne effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.Our\\n current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increasedcomplexity\\n resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19 and permanent work-from-home\\n and  hybrid  work  arrangements,  new  offerings  on  our  platform  or  from  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  and  divestitures.  Further,  weaknesses  in  ourdisclosure\\n controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficultiesencountered\\n in  their  implementation  or  improvement,  could  harm  our  results  of  operations  or  cause  us  to  fail  to  meet  our  reporting  obligations  and  may  result  in  arestatement\\n of our financial statements for prior periods.

Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of theInternet\\n and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates andare\\n subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or todrivers’ businesses.\\nIn\\n addition, local governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislativeaction\\n to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. For example, it is becoming more common for local governments to impose per trip fees specifically onTNC rides.\\n As one example, voters in San Francisco approved “Proposition D” in November of 2019, which imposes a percentage-based tax on TNC rides originating inthe city.\\n Such taxes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We\\n are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, andwe\\n may face indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities have raisedand may\\n continue to raise questions about or challenge or disagree with our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes, and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictionsin\\n which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and interest. A successful assertion by one or more taxauthorities requiring\\n us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes,could\\n result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past transactions, as well as penalties and interest, and could discourage drivers and riders from utilizing ourofferings\\n or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business,  financial  condition,  and  results  of  operations.

Requiring tax reporting or collection could decrease driver or rider activity, which wouldharm\\n our business. New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audi\\nt requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As\\n a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference\\n may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.\\nOperating as\\n a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our managementteam have limited exper\\nience managing a public company.As\\n a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to thereporting requirements of the\\n Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, therules\\n and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  the  listing  standards  of  the  Nasdaq  Stock  Market.

We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls andprocedures\\n and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financialcompliance\\n costs,  and  increase  demand  on  our  systems.  In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  may  be  subject  to  stockholder  activism,  which  can  lead  to  additionalsubstantial\\n costs,  distract  management  and  impact  the  manner  in  which  we  operate  our  business  in  ways  we  cannot  currently  anticipate.

Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being apublic\\n company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts andinvestors.\\n These  obligations  and  constituents  will  require  significant  attention  from  our  senior  management  and  could  divert  their  attention  away  from  the  day-to-daymanagement of our business, which \\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Climate change may have a long-term i\\nmpact on our business.We have established environmental programs, such as our\\n commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, and requiring our suppliers to ensure theefficient\\n use of raw materials, water, and energy resources via our Supplier Code of Conduct, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks whereverbusiness\\n is conducted.  For example,  our San Francisco,  California  headquarters  is projected  to  be vulnerable  to future  water  scarcity  and sea level  rise  due to climatechange,\\n as well as climate-related events including wildfires and associated power shut-offs. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weatherevents\\n and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, and the business of ourcustomers,\\n and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climatechange policies\\n such as California’s Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program, which imposes greenhouse gas and EV requirements on our industry, and failure to meetthe\\n future requirements could have adverse impacts on our costs and ability to operate in California, as well as public goodwill towards our company. We advocate for EVprograms\\n that can be efficiently accessed by drivers on our platform and rental car operators, and any failure of such programs to address EV capital costs, EV chargingcosts,\\n and  EV  charging  infrastructure  in  the  context  of  transportation  network  companies’  unique  needs  could  challenge  our  ability  to  progress  toward  our  100%  EVcommitment.\\n Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,depreciation,\\n asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise notsuccessful,\\n our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected.

In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Flexdrive, whichis\\n now  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Flexdrive  remained  responsible  for  its  obligations  under  a  Loan  and  Security  Agreement,  as  amended,  with  a  third-party  lender,  aMaster\\n Vehicle Acquisition Financing and Security Agreement, as amended, with a third-party lender and a Vehicle Procurement Agreement, as amended, with a third-party;\\n and, following the acquisition, we continued to guarantee the payments of Flexdrive for any amounts borrowed under these agreements.

As of December 31, 2021, we had $711.4 million ofindebtedness for borrowed money outs\\ntanding.Our ability to make schedul\\ned payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subjectto\\n economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service ourdebt\\n and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets,restructuring\\n debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or futureindebtedness\\n will  depend  on the  capital  markets  and  our  financial  condition  at  such  time.  We  may  not  be  able  to  engage  in  any  of  these  activities  or  engage  in  theseactivities\\n on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants thatmay\\n prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, couldresult in the accel\\neration of our debt.In\\n addition,  our  indebtedness,  combined  with  our  other  financial  obligations  and  contractual  commitments,  could  have  other  important  consequences.  Forexample, it could:\\n•\\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in governmentregulation;\\n•\\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;•\\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;•\\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and•\\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.Further,\\n as  of  January  1,  2022,  LIBOR  settings  for  all  non-U.S.  dollar  currencies  and  U.S.  dollar  one-week  and  two-month  LIBOR  settings  ceased  beingpublished,\\n provided or representative.

If new methods of calculating LIBOR are establishedor if other benchmark rates\\n used to price indebtedness or investments are established, the terms of any existing or future indebtedness or investments, including the terms ofFlexdrive’s debt instrumen\\nts, may be negatively impacted, resulting in increased interest expense or lower than expected interest income.In\\n addition, under certain of our and our subsidiary’s existing debt instruments, we and Flexdrive are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenantsregarding our\\n business and operations, including limitations on Flexdrive’s ability to enter into certain acquisitions or consolidations or engage in certain asset dispositions.If\\n we or Flexdrive, as applicable, do not comply with these covenants or otherwise default under the arrangements, and do not obtain a waiver or consent from the lenders,then,\\n subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involveadditional\\n restrictive  covenants  relating  to  our  capital-raising  activities  and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtainadditional capital\\n to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures.

It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use NOLs before their expiration, or atall.\\n Under Section 382 of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation  undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change\\n NOLs to offset its post-change  income may be limited.  In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative  change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” \\nthat exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use net operating lossesto\\n reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that may occur in thefuture.\\nThe\\n Tax Act, as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, among other things, includes changes to the rules governingour\\n U.S. Federal NOLs. NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation (as calculated before taking theNOLs\\n into account) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, NOLs arising in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are subject to a five-year carryback andindefinite\\n carryforward, while NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 also are subject to indefinite carryforward but cannot be carried back. Not allstates conform to the Tax Act or CARE\\nS Act and some states have varying conformity to the Tax Act or CARES Act. In future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset isrecognized\\n related to our NOLs, the changes in the carryforward/carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our valuationallowance assessments for NOLs gene\\nrated after December 31, 2017.Risks Related to Governance and Ownership of our Capital Stock Factors\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effe\\nct of concentrating voting power with our Co-Founders, which will limit your ability to influence the outcomeof important transactions, including a change in control.\\nOur\\n Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued andoutstanding\\n shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Accordingly,  Logan  Green,  our  co-founder,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors  holdsapproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our\\n outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holdsapproximately\\n 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influencematters\\n submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale ofall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our C\\no-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may votein\\n a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a changein\\n control  of  our company,  could  deprive  our  stockholders  of  an opportunity  to  receive  a  premium  for  their  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  sale  of our  company  and  mightultimately\\n affect the market price of our Class A common stock.

For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir\\n indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures\\n to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe\\n S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand\\n temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of its  indices;  however,  in October  2018, MSCI announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  “withunequal\\n voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital\\n structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively\\n track those indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are still fairly new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on thevaluations\\n of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat\\n are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake\\n similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude\\n investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class Acommon stock could be adverse\\nly affected.The trading price of our Class A common stock may be vola\\ntile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.The\\n trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol.\\n These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock.

As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable\\n exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United Stat\\nes in the open market.Sales of our\\n Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in thesection\\n titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments\\n and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions\\n and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited\\n the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform\\n leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.\\nAlthough\\n we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of thepandemic,\\n demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. Theextent\\n to  which  our  operations  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  will  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  beaccurately predicted,\\n including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authoritiesand\\n private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has causedmany\\n businesses to delay employees returning to the office. Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued socialdistancing, altered consu\\nmer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot b\\ne presently estimated.In\\n response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing\\n and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.\\n56\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 mill\\nion paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\\n divestiture did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued\\n operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated\\n statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial statements for informationregarding the divestitu\\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liabil\\nity InsuranceOn\\n April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Valley Insurance Company, Inc. (“PVIC”), entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement (the“Reinsurance\\n Agreement”) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (“DARAG”), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace\\n as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded toDARAG\\n approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with anaggregate\\n limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (“the Reinsurance Transaction”). The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC ofits\\n obligations to the policyholder. A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement ofoperations for the nine mon\\nths ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.Active Riders and Revenue per Active Rider\\nThe\\n COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  significant  decrease  in  Active  Riders  and  in  revenue  per  Active  Rider  beginning  March  2020.  Though  we  experienced  arecovery in\\n revenue per Active Rider and the number of Active Riders in 2021, the number of Active Rider levels have not reached levels we experienced prior to the onsetof\\n the pandemic in March 2020.

An Active Rider is identified bya\\n unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count\\n as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an\\n organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is access\\nible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning\\n in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft\\n updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider’s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir\\n ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were exc\\nluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With\\n the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods\\n ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities\\n fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts\\n since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended \\nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts \\nfrom COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months period\\ns ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods\\n in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited\\n people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared\\n to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides,\\n reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide. Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and dataaccess agreements, beg\\ninning in the second quarter of 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur\\n consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  are  prepared  in  accordance  withGAAP.\\n The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  also  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,revenue,\\n costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonableunder\\n the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, ourfuture financial st\\natement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.We\\n believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the mostcritical\\n to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 of the notes to ourconsolidated financia\\nl statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue Recognition\\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606)\\nWe\\n generate substantially all our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders.

This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind,\\n receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in t\\nhe transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on\\n a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider\\n or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver’s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to pro\\nvide a transportation service to theircustomer\\n through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction\\n price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result\\n, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We\\n report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider.\\n We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide\\n transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation s\\nervices by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We\\n consider the ToS and our customary business practices in identifying the contracts under ASC 606. As our customary business practice, a contract existsbetween\\n the driver and us when the driver’s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson\\n behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\\n’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn\\n service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charge\\nd to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol\\n the driver’s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver’s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn\\n a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to \\na rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We\\n recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the complet\\nion of the ride.We\\n offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estim\\nate the fair value of goods or services received.In\\n some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides\\n for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the \\ncontract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We\\n recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription p\\neriod.We\\n generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access toFlexdrive\\n vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period. We act as a principal in delivering the data and accesslicenses and\\n present revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery and vehicle access, are determined by assigning therelative fair\\n value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratably over the quarter for access to fleet vehicles asour\\n respective  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  upon  the  delivery  of  each.  Refer  to  Note  4  \"Divestitures\"  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  informationregarding the divestitu\\nre of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nWe\\n generate  rental  revenues  primarily  from  Flexdrive,  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  and  Lyft  Rentals.  Under  the  Flexdrive  and  Lyft  Rentals  programs,  weoperate\\n a fleet of rental vehicles comprised of both vehicles owned by us and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. We either lease or sublease vehicles todrivers\\n and Lyft Rentals renters, as a result, we are considered the accounting lessor or sublessor, as applicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Forvehicles\\n that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financial statements. Driverswho rent vehicles are cha\\nrged rental fees, which we collect from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the Lyft Platform.59\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Revenue generated from Flexdriveand\\n Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we c\\nlassify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance Reserves\\nWe\\n utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure\\n costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate\\n law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet\\n reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined ona\\n quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss\\n development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.\\nInsurance\\n claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions\\n based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial\\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic\\n and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from\\n previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while webelieve\\n that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that willultimately\\n be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We\\n continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and e\\nconomic environment evolves.Stock-Based Compensation\\nWe incur stock-based comp\\nensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (“PSUs”), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\\nWe\\n estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors and consultants and ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricingmodel.\\n The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.  Werecognize compensation \\nexpense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The\\n fair  value  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  estimated  based  on  the  fair  market  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based\\n on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the satisfaction ofboth a service condition and \\na performance condition.Compensation\\n expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance\\n condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of  our  IPORegistration\\n Statement on March 28, 2019. On that date we recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the accelerated attributionmethod\\n for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to theseRSUs\\n is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction of aservice-based\\n condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation costrelated to RSUs was $587.5 million, which we expe\\nct to recognize over the remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.Business Combinations\\nWe account for our\\n business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchaseconsideration\\n to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value ofpurchase\\n consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed, we make significant estimates and\\n assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to bereasonable,\\n but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.

For more information regarding our use of these measuresand a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\nContribution and Contribution Margin\\nContribution\\n and  Contribution  Margin  are  measures  used  by  our  management  to  understand  and  evaluate  our  operating  performance  and  trends.  We  believeContribution\\n and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally increased overthe periods presented as r\\nevenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.We define Contribution as r\\nevenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:•\\namortization of int angible assets;•\\nstock-based compensation exp ense;•\\npayroll tax expense rel ated to stock-based compensation;•\\nchanges to the liabilities f or insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;•\\ntransaction costs related to  certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and•\\nrestructuring charges, if any.For more information about \\ncost of revenue, see the section titled “Components of Results of Operations—Cost of Revenue.”Contribution Margin is calcu\\nlated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.We\\n record  changes  to  historical  liabilities  for  insurance  required  by  regulatory  agencies  for  financial  reporting  purposes  in  the  quarter  of  positive  or  adversedevelopment\\n even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million\\n for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe\\n prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod\\n changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,including\\n the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do notadjust\\n the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end. Annual Contribution iscalculated\\n by adding Contribution of the last four quarters. We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatoryagencies\\n from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  periodresults.\\nDuring the\\n second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between October1,\\n 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a Novation Agreement for the transfer ofcertain\\n legacy  auto  insurance  liabilities  between  October  1,  2015  and  September  30,  2018.  Refer  to  Note  6  “Supplemental  Financial  Statement  Information”  to  theconsolidated\\n financial  statements  for  information  regarding  these  transactions.  We  believe  the  costs  associated  with  these  transactions  related  to  certain  legacy  autoinsurance\\n liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations despite this transaction occurring in the current period because the impactedinsurance liabilities relate\\n to claims that date back years.

When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would\\n be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod\\n of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date cumulative losses collected and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter. The amount of thedeferral\\n will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance\\n Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod\\n to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including\\n any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance\\n Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove\\n over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges\\n to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent\\n period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date\\n back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated\\n to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation\\n of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.\\n As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidatedstatement of operations.\\nWe\\n had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economicchallenges\\n resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business.

Basis for Opinions\\nThe\\n Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and forits\\n assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearingunder Item 9A. Our responsibility is\\n to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reportingbased\\n on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to beindependent\\n with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Securities  and  ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.\\nWe\\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB. Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\\n about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was mai\\nntained in all material respects.Our\\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe\\n amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as\\n evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan\\n understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our au\\ndits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Webelieve that our audits p\\nrovide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Repor\\ntingA\\n company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial\\n statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reportingincludes\\n those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof\\n the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally\\n accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors\\n of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’sassets that could have\\n a material effect on the financial statements.Because\\n of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness\\n to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures m\\nay deteriorate.75\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves\\n totaled $1,069 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas\\n one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis\\n of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.\\nThe\\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant\\n judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming\\n procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss d\\nevelopment factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the\\n matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\\n These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods\\n and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge\\n to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement’s\\n actuarially  determined  reserves.  Developing  the  independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  historical  data  provided  bymanagement, and independen\\ntly developing loss development factors.Valuation of Certain Elements of the Transac\\ntion with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (“Woven Planet”)As\\n described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation,\\n for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company’s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof\\n Lyft rideshare and fleet data. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand\\n $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangementconsideration\\n was  attributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  theutilization\\n of Lyft rideshare and fleet data.

The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used toestimate\\n the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the standaloneselling price of the r\\nideshare data.The principal\\n considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain elements of the transaction with Woven Planet isa\\n critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  a high degree  of auditor  judgment  and  subjectivity  in performing  procedures  relating  to the  fair  value  of  the Level  5 division  assets  andestimated\\n standalone selling price of the rideshare data due to the significant judgment by management when determining the values; (ii) the significant audit effort inevaluating\\n management’s significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve and the estimated miles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license; and(iii) the audit ef\\nfort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.76\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nLyft,\\n Inc.  (the  “Company”  or  “Lyft”)  is  incorporated  in  Delaware  with  its  headquarters  in  San  Francisco,  California.  The  Company  operates  multimodaltransportation\\n networks  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  that  offer  access  to  a  variety  of  transportation  options  through  the  Company’s  platform  and  mobile-basedapplications.\\n This network enables multiple modes of transportation including the facilitation of peer-to-peer ridesharing by connecting drivers who have a vehicle withriders\\n who  need  a  ride.  The  Lyft  Platform  provides  a  marketplace  where  drivers  can  be  matched  with  riders  via  the  Lyft  App  where  the  Company  operates  as  atransportation network comp\\nany (“TNC”).Transportation\\n options through the Company’s platform and mobile-based applications are substantially comprised of its ridesharing marketplace that connectsdrivers and riders in cities across the\\n United States and in select cities in Canada, Lyft’s network of Light Vehicles, the Express Drive program, where drivers can enter intoshort-term\\n rental  agreements  with  Flexdrive  or  a  third  party  for  vehicles  that  may  be  used  to  provide  ridesharing  services  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  Lyft  Rentals,  aconsumer\\n offering for users who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use, and Lyft Driver Centers and Lyft Auto Care, where drivers and riders canrequest auto maintenance an\\nd collision repair services offered through the Lyft Platform in certain markets.Basis of Presentation\\nThese\\n consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) andinclude the accounts of th\\ne Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.The\\n Company  uses  the  U.S.  dollar  predominantly  as  the  functional  currency  of  its  foreign  subsidiaries.  For  foreign  subsidiaries  where  the  U.S.  dollar  is  thefunctional\\n currency, gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency balances into U.S. dollars are included on the consolidated statements of operations. For theforeign\\n subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded to aseparate component of a\\nccumulated other comprehensive loss.Initial Public Offering\\nThe\\n Company’s registration  statement  on Form S-1 (the “IPO Registration  Statement”)  related  to its initial  public  offering  (“IPO”) was declared  effective  onMarch\\n 28,  2019,  and  the  Company’s  Class  A common  stock  began  trading  on  the  Nasdaq  Global  Select  Market  on  March  29,  2019.  On April  2,  2019,  the  Companycompleted\\n its IPO, in which the Company sold 32,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share. On April 9, 2019, the Companysold\\n an additional 2,996,845 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $72.00 per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchaseadditional\\n shares. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $2.5 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $70.3 million and offeringexpenses of $7.7 million subjec\\nt to certain cost reimbursements.Immediately\\n prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  219,175,709  shares  of  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  then  outstanding  converted  into  an  equivalentnumber\\n of shares of common stock. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, whichauthorizes a total\\n of 18,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, and 1,000,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Upon thefiling of\\n the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 255,007,393 shares of the Company’s common stock then outstanding were automatically reclassified intoan\\n equivalent  number  of  shares  of  the  Company’s  Class  A  common  stock.  Immediately  after  the  reclassification  and  prior  to  the  completion  of  the  IPO,  a  total  of12,779,709 shares of Class A\\n common stock held by Logan Green, John Zimmer and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares ofClass\\n B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a result, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has two classes of authorizedand outstanding common stock: Class A co\\nmmon stock and Class B common stock.2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe\\n preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets\\n and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring\\n the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected\\n future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from \\nother sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Company has adopted a number of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safetyrequirements\\n for ridesharing and updating workplace policies. The Company also made adjustments to its expenses and cash flow to correlate with declines in revenuesincluding\\n headcount reductions in 2020. Refer to Note 17 “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the 2020 restructuring events. The\\n Company  cannot  be  certain  that  these  actions  will  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  Lyft's  business.  As  of  the  date  of  issuance  of  the  financialstatements,\\n the Company is not aware of any material event or circumstance that would require it to update its estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of theCompany's\\n assets or liabilities, including the recording of any credit losses. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, andcould\\n lead to impairment of long lived assets or goodwill, or credit losses associated with investments or other assets, and the impact of such changes on estimates will berecognized\\n on the consolidated  financial  statements  as soon as they become known. Actual  results could differ  from those estimates  and any such differences  may bematerial to the Company'\\ns financial statements.Segment Information\\nOperating\\n segments  are  defined  as  components  of  an  entity  for  which  separate  financial  information  is  available  and  that  is  regularly  reviewed  by  the  ChiefOperating\\n Decision  Maker  (“CODM”)  in  deciding  how  to  allocate  resources  to  an  individual  segment  and  in  assessing  performance.  The  Company’s  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer\\n is  the Company’s  CODM. The  CODM reviews  financial  information  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions,  allocatingresources,\\n and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment. During the years ended December 31,2021,\\n 2020 and 2019, the Company did not generate material international revenues and as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have materialassets located outside of \\nthe United States.Revenue Recognition\\nThe\\n Company generates its revenue from its multimodal transportation networks that offer access to a variety of transportation options through the Lyft Platformand\\n mobile-based applications.

The Company generates revenue from service fees and commissions(collectively, “fees”) paid by\\n drivers for use of the Lyft Platform and related activities to connect drivers with riders to facilitate and successfully complete rides via the LyftApp\\n where  the  Company  operates  as  a  TNC.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (“ToS”)  with  theCompany\\n in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related\\n activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a\\n transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.\\nAs\\n the Company’s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver’s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically\\n is upon pickup of the rider. The Company’s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful\\n transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe\\n ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider’s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees befo\\nre making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver’s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The\\n Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable\\n subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.\\nThe\\n Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata\\n and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal\\n in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligation\\ns. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for a\\nccess to fleet vehicles as the Company’s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)\\nThe\\n Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related a\\nctivities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The\\n Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany\\n either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable,\\n in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as\\n applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements. Drivers who rent v\\nehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver’s earnings on the LyftPlatform.\\nDue\\n to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases. Revenuegenerated\\n from single-use ride fees paid by Light Vehicle riders is recognized upon completion of each related ride. Revenue generated from Flexdrive and Lyft Rentals isrecognized evenly over th\\ne rental period, which is typically seven days or less.Enterprise and Trade Receivables\\nThe\\n Company collects any fees owed for completed transactions on the Lyft Platform primarily from the rider’s authorized payment method. Uncollected fees areincluded\\n in  prepaid  expenses  and  other  current  assets  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  represent  receivables  from  (i)  participants  in  the  Company’s  enterpriseprograms (“Enterprise Users”), where the transacti\\nons have been completed and the amounts owed from the Enterprise Users have either been invoiced or are unbilled as ofthe reporting date; and (ii) riders where the authorized payment method is a credit card but the fare amounts have not yet settled wit\\nh third-party payment processors. Underthe\\n ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platform and related activities from the fare and related chargesit\\n collects from riders on behalf of drivers. Accordingly, the Company has no trade receivables from drivers. The portion of the fare receivable to be remitted to drivers isincluded in accrued and oth\\ner current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.The\\n Company records an allowance for credit losses for fees owed for completed transactions that may never settle or be collected. As a result of the adoption ofAccounting\\n Standards Update No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses\" (“ASC 326”), the Company’s measurement of the allowance for credit losses has beenaugmented to reflect the chan\\nge from the incurred loss87\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade\\n receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and\\n business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are wr\\nitten off when determined to be uncollectible.The\\n Company’s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember\\n 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020\\n and 2019, respectively.  The write-offs were immaterial  for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in the allowance  for credit losses for the year endedDecember\\n 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for\\n the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe\\n allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.\\nIncentive Programs\\nThe\\n Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives\\n while riders,  Light Vehicle  riders and Lyft Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or discounted  rides  under such incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers,\\n Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany’s customers, incentiv\\nes provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver Incentives\\nThe\\n Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.\\n These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany\\n reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely\\n outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes\\n not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring\\n new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of t\\nhe benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider Incentives\\nThe\\n Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:\\n(i)\\nMarket-wide marketing promotions.  Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This\\n type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver\\n to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date i\\nt records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)\\nTargeted marketing promotions.  Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders. An example isa\\n promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto\\n a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar\\n to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice\\n provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives\\n represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded \\nas sales and marketing expense.(iii)\\nRider  referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir\\n first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge\\n recorded to sales and marketing  expense. Referral  coupons typically  expire within one year. The Company estimates breakage  using its historicalexperience. As of December 31, 2021 \\nand 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing andbike\\n and scooter rentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers. Payment processing charges include merchant fees, chargebacks and failed charges.Other\\n costs  included  in  cost  of  revenue  are  hosting  and  platform-related  technology  costs,  vehicle  lease  expenses,  personnel-related  compensation  costs,  depreciation,amortization of technology-relate\\nd intangible assets, asset write-off charges, and gains and losses related to the sale of vehicles.Operations and Support\\nOperations\\n and support expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation costs of local operations teams and teams who provide phone, email andchat support to\\n users, bike and scooter fleet operations support costs, driver background checks and onboarding costs, facility cost, certain car rental fleet support costs, andfees\\n paid to third-parties providing operations support. Bike and scooter fleet operations support costs include general repairs and maintenance, and other customer supportactivities related to repositioni\\nng bikes and scooters for rider convenience, cleaning and safety checks.Research and Development\\nResearch\\n and  development  expenses  primarily  consist  of  personnel-related  compensation  costs  and  facilities  costs.

The expected term of the ESPPpurchase\\n rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as apublic\\n company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights\\n using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasuryzero-coupon issues simila\\nr in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.The\\n fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. TheCompany recognizes compensat\\nion expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PS\\nUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined\\n based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both \\na service condition and a performance condition.Compensation\\n expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance\\n condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration\\n Statement on  March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for \\nthe RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service period\\ns. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condit\\nion only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based\\n compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessar\\ny, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income Taxes\\nThe\\n Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe\\n estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that\\n are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Compa\\nny records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net\\n amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and \\nrisks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions\\n of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby\\n the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more \\nlikely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe\\n technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expenseline in the accompanying \\nconsolidated statement of operations.Business Combinations\\nThe\\n Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof\\n purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fairvalue\\n of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired andliabilities\\n assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are basedupon assumptions believed to be r\\neasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result,90\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Acquisitioncosts, such as legal and consult\\ning fees, are expensed as incurred.Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash\\n equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporatebonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity\\n of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Alsoincluded\\n in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,2021 and 2020, and money market deposit \\naccounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted\\n cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged\\n to secure certain letters of credit.Investments\\nDebt Securities\\nThe Company’s accounting for its investme\\nnts in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company’s intended holding period for the security,and\\n the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt sec\\nurities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The\\n Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.  The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the cons\\nolidated statements of operationsas\\n an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore\\n recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking\\n this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security’s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating\\n agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured\\n based on  the  Company's best  estimate  of  the cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.  When  developing  its estimate  of  cash  flows expected  to  be collected,  theCompany\\n considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.\\nCredit\\n loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidate\\nd statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe\\n amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2021, the Companyhad not recorded any credi\\nt impairments. The Company determines realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities on a specific identification method.The Company's investments in debt se\\ncurities include:(i)\\nCash  and  cash  equivalents. Cash  equivalents  include  certificates  of  deposits,  commercial  paper  and  corporate  bonds  that  have  an  originalmaturity of 90 days or less and \\nare readily convertible to known amounts of cash.(ii)\\nShort-term investments.  Short-term  investments are comprised of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which maturein twelve months or less. As a resul\\nt, the Company classifies these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.(iii)\\nRestricted investments.

If  an  impairment  exists,  the  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  by  using  the  best  informationavailable,\\n which may include cash flow projections or other available market data, and recognizes a loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair valueof the investment on the conso\\nlidated statements of operations.Concentrations of Credit Risk\\nThe\\n Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financi\\nal institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordin\\ngly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nThe\\n Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset\\n or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse\\n in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor\\n nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:\\nLevel 1\\nObservable inputs t hat reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2\\nInputs  reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother\\n than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.\\nLevel\\n 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market \\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying\\n values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.\\nLight Vehicle Fleet\\nThe\\n Company’s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand\\n other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 3\\n1, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9\\n million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin\\n service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively. Bikes are \\nincluded in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.Leases\\nThe\\n Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach with an effective date as of the beginning of the fiscal year, January 1, 2019. TheCompany\\n elected the package of transition provisions available for expired or existing contracts, which allowed the Company to carryforward the historical assessments of(1) whether\\n contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification and (3) initial direct costs. In accordance with ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is orcontains\\n a lease at contract inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether the lessee has the right to control such asset. TheCompany\\n determines the classification and measurement of its leases upon lease commencement. The Company enters into certain agreements as a lessor and either leasesor\\n subleases the underlying asset in the agreement to customers. The Company also enters into certain agreements as a lessee. If any of the following criteria are met, theCompany classifies the\\n lease as a financing lease (as a lessee) or as a direct financing or sales-type lease (both as a lessor):•\\nThe lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;•\\nThe lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise;•\\nThe lease term is for 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, unless the commencement date falls within the last 25% of the economiclife of the underlying ass\\net;•\\nThe present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the underlying asset; or•\\nThe underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.92\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents,\\n such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the\\n period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease\\n revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigatesresidual\\n value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present \\nand estimated future market conditions.Lessee\\nThe\\n Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe\\n Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand\\n lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat\\n the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo\\n so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease lia\\nbilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The\\n Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments\\n based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collat\\neralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Compan\\ny’s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included inoperating\\n lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases\\n are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current lia\\nbilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful\\n lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included incost of\\n revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operat\\ning expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and Equipment\\nProperty\\n and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe\\n related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two  and  seven  years.  Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance\\n and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the costand\\n accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in theperiod\\n realized. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets. Construction inprogress is related to prop\\nerty and equipment that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use.Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill\\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.Intangible\\n assets resulting from the acquisition of entities are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting based on management’s estimate of the fair value ofassets received. Intang\\nible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two  to twelve years.Goodwill\\n is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate\\n the carrying value of the reporting unit may be in excess of its fair value. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company first performs a qualitativeassessment\\n to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of theCompany’s\\n reporting  unit  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount,  the  quantitative  impairment  test  will  be  required.  Alternatively,  the  Company  may  bypass  the  qualitativeassessment and perform a qu\\nantitative impairment test.

Such events and changes  may include:  significant  changes in performancerelative\\n to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. The Company measuresrecoverability\\n of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If thecarrying value\\n of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Therewas no impairment of long-l\\nived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Software Development Costs\\nThe\\n Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform\\n and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform\\n the function intended. The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively. For the yea\\nr ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.Insurance Reserves\\nThe\\n Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underi\\nnsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder\\n state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen\\n incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined\\n on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication\\n of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate t\\nhe liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance\\n claims  may take years to completely settle,  and the Company has limited  historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational  history, theCompany\\n makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial\\n models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim\\n remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior\\n year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However,\\n while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As aresult,\\n the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe\\n consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are report\\ned and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per Share\\nThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net\\n loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The\\n two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand\\n participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between commonstock\\n and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s redeemableconvertible\\n preferred  stock  contractually  entitles  the  holders  of  such  shares  to  participate  in  dividends  but  does  not  contractually  require  the  holders  of  such  shares  toparticipate in the Comp\\nany’s losses. There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic net loss per share is co\\nmputed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject\\n to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which theCompany reports\\n net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to commonstockholders, because potent\\nially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.94\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The acquisition is a taxable businesscombination for tax purposes \\nand goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.The\\n fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of thedeveloped\\n technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare\\n avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date.

Divestitures\\nTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. \\n(“Woven Planet”)On July 13, 2021, the Company com\\npleted a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets\\n related to the Company’s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commerci\\nalization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transa\\nction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The\\n divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company’s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting\\n as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable\\n to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare\\n and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on therelative fair\\n value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued usingan\\n adjusted market approach.. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to estimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimatedmiles\\n to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the stand alone selling price of the rideshare data.

The Company has agreed toindemnify\\n and defend the indemnified party’s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claimsbecause of the Company’s act\\nivities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine themaximum\\n potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company’s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved \\nin each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe Company is currently involved \\nin, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary\\n course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense\\n related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company’s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,\\n or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public di\\nsclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related \\nto accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes\\n of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis\\n reasonably  possible,  an estimate  of  the amount  of  loss or  range  of  losses  is not  possible  nor  is  the Company  able  to  estimate  the loss  or  range  of  losses that  couldpotentially\\n result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.\\nIndependent Contractor Classificat\\nion MattersWith\\n regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigation\\ns and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers\\n as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.\\n Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can cr\\neate uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For\\n example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.  Labor  Code  sec.  2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new\\n standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe\\n independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,\\n San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies’  respective  platforms  asindependent\\n contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California’s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits\\n against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies’ respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand\\n material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia\\n as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers\\n utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril\\n 20, 2021, the court granted the parties’ joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor\\n Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition\\n was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia\\n Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied\\n review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that succes\\nsfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda\\n lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and\\n PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit \\nagainst the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief.\\n The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.

TheESPP provides for\\n consecutive, overlapping 12-month offering periods, subject to certain reset provisions as defined in the plan. The initial offering period ran from March28, 2019 through June 30, 2020.\\nA\\n total of 6,000,000 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. On January 1, 2020, an additional 3,025,957 shares ofClass\\n A  common  stock  were  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  ESPP.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax asse\\nts such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company’s history of net losses since its inception.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federa\\nl and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.The\\n federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through2037,\\n while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue\\n to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change lim\\nitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The\\n Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state incom\\ne tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The\\n Company has not provided foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earning\\ns outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to \\nthe participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The\\n Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand\\n penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated\\n statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.

Controls and Procedures.\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur\\n management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand\\n procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the periodcovered by this\\n Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December31, 2021, our disclosure controls and pro\\ncedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Repor\\ntingOur\\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)under\\n the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reportingand the preparation of conso\\nlidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Our\\n management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting as\\n of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations\\n of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.\\nThe\\n effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public ac\\ncounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere\\n were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange\\n Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, including\\n our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrol over financial reporting will prevent all\\n errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance\\n that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be consider\\ned relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and inst\\nances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because\\n of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the\\n controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and\\n there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause\\n of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to e\\nrror or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.\\nNone.\\nItem 9C.

For the avoidance of doubt, Employee’s employment with the Company ends as of the\\nSeparation Date whether or not Employee executes this Agreement.\\n2.\\nSeverance Pay.  If and only if Employee timely signs and does not revoke this Agreement and complies with its terms, then asconsideration, the adequacy of which Employee hereby acknowledges, the Company agrees to pay Employee a severance payment in the gross\\namount of $75,000, less lawful payroll deductions and withholdings (“\\nSeverance Pay”) , an amount to which Employee acknowledges Employee is not otherwise entitled. \\nThe Company will make such payment within 15 business days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, as defined in Section 16, or the Separation Date, whichever date is later (but in all cases no earlier than January 3, 2022). \\nBy Employee’s signature below, Employee authorizes the Company to pay the Severance Pay by direct deposit into Employee’s bank account on file in the Company’s records.\\n3.\\nEquity . The Company previously granted Employee equity award(s) to purchase or receive shares of the Company’s Class Acommon stock set forth on Schedule 1 that remain outstanding as of the date Employee was presented with this Agreement (collectively“\\nEquity Awards\\n”), subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Company equity plan and the award agreement evidencing such Equity Awards (collectively the “\\nEquity Documents ”).

(a) \\nEmployee will continue to receive Employee’s current benefits, if any, under the Company-sponsored benefit plans, for the periodthrough the last day of the month in which Employee’s Separation Date occurs.

Such\\neligibility and coverage will be governed exclusively by the continuation coverage provisions of the Company’s group insurance plans (which may\\nbe amended from time to time) and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (“COBRA”).\\n(b) A “qualifying event” for purposes of COBRA coverage occurred on the Separation Date.

Employee acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement, including the foregoing consideration, constitutes an admission of liability, express or implied, on the part of the Company with respect to any fact or matter which may be involved in\\nEmployee’s employment with or separation of employment from the Company.

Besides waiving rights and releasing claims encompassed by the General Release in Section 7(a) above, Employee promises not to bring a lawsuit or arbitration against the Company alleging any claim or violation of rights covered by that General Release. This\\nCovenant Not to Sue is different from the General Release in that it is an affirmative promise by Employee, violation of which can result in a claim\\nfor damages by the Company against Employee. Details regarding exceptions to this covenant and damages Employee must pay for violating it are\\ncontained in Sections 7(d) and 18 below.\\n(c) \\nWaiver of Unknown Claims. This general and complete release covers both claims that Employee knows about and those that Employee may not know about and that exist in Employee’s favor at the time of executing this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Employee is not waiving, releasing or giving up any claim for workers’ compensation benefits or unemployment benefits to which the Employee has an unwaivable right, vested pension or savings plan\\nbenefits, claims to enforce this Agreement, claims under sections 2800 to 2810 of the California Labor Code, and claims under other state statutes\\nthat may not be waived as a matter of law in an agreement of this type. Employee acknowledges, however, that Employee has no work-related injury\\nor illness at the time of signing this Agreement for which Employee has not already filed a workers compensation claim. Nothing in any part of this\\nAgreement limits or waives Employee’s right to file a charge with an administrative agency, provide testimony or other information to an agency, or\\ntake part in any agency investigation; however, Employee is waiving Employee’s right to recover any monetary or other relief in connection with\\nsuch an investigation or charge filed by Employee or by any other individual, or a charge filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\nor any other federal, state or local agency. If Employee is awarded money damages as described in the previous sentence, Employee shall decline to\\naccept any such monetary award.

(a) \\nConfidential or Proprietary Information. Employee acknowledges that, by reason of Employee’s employment, Employee had access to confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information (including customer lists not known to the public) of the Company, and that Employee\\nunderstands Employee’s obligations under the law and agrees not to disclose or divulge to any third party or otherwise use or allow to be used in any\\nmanner (whether for Employee’s benefit, for the benefit of another individual or entity, or otherwise) any confidential, trade secret or proprietary\\ninformation concerning the operations or business of the Company at any time following the Separation Date. These obligations shall not apply to\\ninformation that (i) is now a part of public knowledge or literature or is generally known in the industry; or (ii) hereafter becomes a part of the public\\nknowledge or generally known in the industry from a source other than Employee, either directly or indirectly. Moreover, nothing in this Agreement\\nshall limit Employee’s ability to report possible violations of law in confidence to the appropriate government agency or entity or make other\\ndisclosures protected under the whistleblower provisions of applicable federal or state law or regulation. Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of\\n2016, Employee will not face civil or criminal liability for disclosing a trade secret: (1) to a government official or an attorney, if the disclosure is\\nmade in confidence and for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a document filed in a lawsuit or other\\nproceeding, provided the document is filed under seal. \\nIn addition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose a trade secret to Employee’s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,\\nprovided the document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and Employee does not otherwise disclose the trade secret except pursuant to\\ncourt order. \\nThe confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in this paragraph are in addition to, and not in lieu of, Employee’s obligations under the Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement that Employee signed on October 6, 2014 (the “Confidentiality Agreement”),\\nand Employee will remain bound by the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, at all times in the future, even after the Separation Date.\\n(b) \\nConfidentiality of Agreement.

A breach of\\nthese obligations by Employee’s spouse/domestic partner, attorney, advisor, or agents will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Employee.\\nMoreover, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Employee from disclosing the terms and conditions of this Agreement to government agencies\\nfor tax purposes (i.e., the IRS and Franchise Tax Board); or if required by a valid court order, subpoena, or regulatory request or other compulsory\\nprocess or law; provided, however, that Employee shall advise such agency or court of the confidential nature of this Agreement and shall exercise\\nreasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the subject matter disclosed. Further, the Company\\nagrees that it will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to not publicly disclose any potential employment opportunity Employee may have\\nprior to Employee or Employee’s new employer/company announcing it, with the exception of required disclosures to the Company’s Board of\\nDirectors or advisors, or required by law, under applicable confidentiality obligations.\\n(c) \\nBreach of Confidentiality Provisions/Liquidated Damages. Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee’s attorney, or Employee’saccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the Severance\\nPay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of the\\ndisclosure of such information on the Company’s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damages\\nresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employee\\neither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee’s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company the\\nsum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable. Nothing herein shall\\nlimit or restrict any other remedies available to the Company, at law or in equity, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Employee of any\\nobligations under this Agreement.    \\n13.\\nCooperation .  Following the Separation Date, Employee also agrees to cooperate with the Company in regard to the transition of thebusiness matters handled by Employee on behalf of the Company. Employee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Company and its counsel in the\\ndefense or prosecution of any claims or actions now in existence or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company, or in\\nany investigation or review that may be performed by the Company or any governmental authority, which relate in any way to events or occurrences\\nthat transpired while Employee was employed by the Company or about which Employee may have knowledge. Employee’s cooperation in\\nconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company’s counsel to\\nprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company at\\nmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but not\\nincluding attorneys’ fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.\\n14.\\nNon-Disparagement . The Parties agree that they will not disparage, discredit or otherwise defame one another, including the Company or its officers, directors and employees, in any form, manner, or media, including but not limited to oral or written statements, social\\nmedia, or any other form of electronic communication, or otherwise take any action which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the\\npersonal or business reputation of the Parties. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Parties from testifying truthfully in any valid judicial or\\ngovernment agency proceeding.\\n15.\\nArbitration . To the fullest extent permitted by law, the parties agree to resolve any disputes that they may have with each other regarding the validity, interpretation, applicability, or effect of this Agreement or any alleged violations of it, through final, binding, and confidential\\narbitration with JAMS, in accordance with JAMS employment law rules, available at \\nhttps://www.jamsadr.com/rules- 5\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nUber\\n Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\\n platform  (“platform(s)”  or  “Platform(s)”).  We  connect  consumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  forridesharing\\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (“Eater(s)”)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with  deliveryservice\\n providers  (“Couriers”)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “end-user(s)”  or“consumer(s).”\\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\\nAs\\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\\nagmented markets.Mobility\\nMobility\\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \\nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\\nOur\\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\\nDuring\\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The DrizlyGroup,\\n Inc. (“Drizly”), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly’s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. Theacquisition\\n of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination. For additional information, see Note 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item8, “Financial Statements \\nand Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Freight\\nWe believe that Freigh\\nt is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries\\n to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis\\n highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of theprocess\\n conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally\\n difficult  for carriers  to find and book the shipments  that work for their businesses,  spending hours on the phone negotiating  pricing  and terms.  Theseinefficiencies adv\\nersely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or “dead-head” miles,4\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand\\n accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricingand the ability to book a shipm\\nent with the touch of a button.We\\n serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,secure\\n capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors representsignificant efficiency improvement\\ns over traditional freight brokerage providers.During\\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight businessthrough\\n Transplace’s  expertise  in transportation  management.  The acquisition  of Transplace  has been accounted  for as a business combination.  For additionalinformation, see Note\\n 18 – Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nPlatform Synergies\\nOur Platform\\nThe\\n foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.\\nMassive Network\\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers,\\n as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In\\n approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope ev\\nentually billions, of people.Leading Technology\\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep\\n technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it ex\\ntremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational Excellence\\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\\ncities and regulators.\\nProduct Expertise\\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform\\n users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.\\nWe intend to continue to inv\\nest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We\\n believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform\\n users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery\\n attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.\\n Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage,\\n compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these t\\nrends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With\\n our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-pl\\natform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice,\\n and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities\\n as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers. We exited\\n 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our“Super App” view on iOS and Android, which combines our mul\\ntiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.We\\n are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlockingcross-platform adver\\ntising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.Competitive Environment\\nWe\\n compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and inthe\\n logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competitionfrom new market entrants \\ngiven the low barriers to entry that characterize5\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additionalcompetition. While\\n we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan we do. The competition we fa\\nce in each of our offerings includes:•\\nMobility.  Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the marketsthat\\n we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,public\\n transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.We\\n also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint ventu\\nre.•\\nDelivery.  Our  Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in  the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in  various  regions  for  drivers,consumers, and\\n merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. OurDelivery offering also c\\nompetes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.•\\nFreight.  Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe operate\\n in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and\\n regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments,\\n labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly\\n evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are des\\ncribed below.Mobility\\nOur\\n platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions\\n in  which  we  operate.  A large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in fo\\nreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In\\n the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including\\n licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and\\n regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including\\n Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations\\n banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexi\\nties for our business and operating model.Substantially\\n all states in the United States and numerous municipalities  in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation NetworkCompany (“TNC”) regulations. These r\\negulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their ownvehicles\\n to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle insp\\nections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In\\n addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California’s AssemblyBill\\n 5  (“AB5”),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney\\n General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\\n and sought an injunction  and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive  advantage caused by the alleged  misclassification  of drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enj\\noining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the\\n parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot\\n initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able\\n to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith\\n the provisions of Proposition 22.

For example:•\\nIn London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November2019,\\n TfL  declined  to  issue  us  a  license,  finding  that  we  were  not  “fit  and  proper,”  including  with  respect  to  confidence  in  our  change  and  releasemanagement\\n processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same condi\\ntions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.•\\nSince April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements,\\n including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing\\n requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices.\\n Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on\\n our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\\n•\\nIn January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be pi\\ncked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.•\\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon\\n the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime\\n and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on\\n our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour\\n platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement\\n minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislativeor regulatory initia\\ntives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.See\\n the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significantcomplexities for our busin\\ness and operating model.As we continue to expand our offerings, we \\nmay be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.Data Privacy and Protection\\nOur\\n technology  platform,  and  the  user  data  we  collect  and  process  to  run  our  business,  are  an  integral  part  of  our  business  model  and,  as  a  result,  ourcompliance\\n with  laws  dealing  with  the  collection  and  processing  of  personal  data  is  core  to  our  strategy  to  improve  platform  user  experience  and  build  trust.Regulators\\n around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing ofpersonally\\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Twoexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the Europea\\nn Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a lawwhich went into effect in\\n May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the CaliforniaConsumer\\n Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirementsfor\\n covered  businesses.  U.S.  state,  city,  and  foreign  regulators  are  expected  to  continue  proposing  and  adopting  significant  laws  impacting  the  processing  ofpersonally\\n identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November2020 (effective in Janua\\nry 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.Payments and Financial Services\\nMost\\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, UberPayments\\n B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  as  an  electronic  money  institution  in  support  of  certain  payment  activities  in  the  European  Economic  Area  (the“EEA”).\\n Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtainlicenses\\n to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such lawscould\\n affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals inseveral other jurisdi\\nctions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.Antitrust\\nCompetition\\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are do\\ning so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as7\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We have typically \\nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19\\n pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pande\\nmic continues.Delivery\\nWe\\n typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical\\n growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which acc\\nelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at Uber\\nEmployees\\nWe\\n are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately\\n 72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.  Our  human  capital  strategies  are  developed  and  managed  by  our  Chief  PeopleOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and ar\\ne overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.Our\\n success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject\\n to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.Adapting\\n to  a  New  Way  of  Working.  In  2021,  the  ever-evolving  COVID-19  pandemic  continued  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  our  employees  and  ourworkforce management st\\nrategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work. As a result of COVID-19, in 2020, we asked that all employees who were able todo\\n so work remotely and while we subsequently announced return to office dates, the dynamic COVID situation disrupted our return to office plans—althoughmany\\n of our offices are open, we have not yet set an updated return to office date. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced newdynamics\\n into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stressand\\n social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  The  issues  of  stress  and  balance  were  particularly  exacerbated  among  caregivers  of  youngchildren.\\n To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigatedthis crisis in their pe\\nrsonal and professional lives.

To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need thro\\nugh employee engagement surveysand\\n related  tools. We historically  conducted a semi-annual  workforce  survey that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and well-being.  But in2021,\\n we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results ofthese regular checks to\\n better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth\\n opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased\\n on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metri\\ncs such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee\\n Development  and  Retention.  We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to d\\nrive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough\\n internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem\\n to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness\\n and  productivity.  This  helps  our  diverse  employee  base  manage  life’s  expected  and  unexpected  events.  Globally,  Uber  offers  competitive  benefitspackages to our employees and \\ntheir families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.For\\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, futureattrition,\\n or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our2021 People and Culture Report, which is ava\\nilable on our website.

We  encouragedifferent\\n opinions  and  approaches  to  be  heard,  and  then  we  come  together  and  build.  We  believe  that  when  employees  feel  empowered  to  succeed  in  a  workenvironment\\n that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implementprocesses\\n throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,LGBTQIA+ individuals, people\\n with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadershiproles come from historically \\nunderrepresented groups.Our\\n Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensationpackages of our most senior ex\\necutives.We\\n encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or theIntegrity Helpline.\\nAs\\n a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To dothat,\\n we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.In\\n July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.Some of our commitments to \\nanti-racism include:•\\nRidding our platform of racism•\\nFighting racism with technology•\\nSustaining equity and belonging for all•\\nDriving equity in the communityFor\\n more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which areavailable on our website.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employm\\nent. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-bas\\ned work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,\\n flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic\\n coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportuniti\\nes. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy\\n compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither\\n an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber,\\n we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\\n•\\nAdvocacy:  We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould\\n be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and otherapp\\n based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve f\\nlexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:◦\\nIn  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers,\\n platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work—one where having accessto protections and benefi\\nts doesn’t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.◦\\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to providebenefits, including heal\\nthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.◦\\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis\\n change, drivers who use Uber’s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also annou\\nnced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers \\nand to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.•\\nProtections and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing addition\\nal protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.•\\nEarnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about wher\\ne and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).•\\nProgression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree\\n programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their fami\\nly members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.•\\nEngagement:  We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe thatthe\\n best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Driversto participate\\n in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveysto gather feedback on our app, ou\\nr support services, and other matters.For\\n additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers, whether\\n as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adverselyimpacted.”\\n included  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  as  well  our  2021  ESG  Report  and  our  2021  People  and  Culture  Report.

In addition, our launch of new, or expanding existing, services, features,or\\n health  and  safety  requirements  in  response  to  COVID-19  may  heighten  other  risks  described  in  this  “Risk  Factors”  section,  including  our  classification  ofDrivers. These challenges cou\\nld result in fines or other enforcement measures that could adversely impact our financial results or operations.The\\n COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our near-term financial results and may adversely impact our long-term financial results, which has requiredand\\n may continue to require significant actions in response, including but not limited to, additional reductions in workforce and certain changes to pricing modelsof\\n our offerings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot\\n believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.\\n The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including theduration of the spread of th\\ne outbreak and any future “waves” or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the United States, theadministration,\\n adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact on global supplychains,\\n foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to ourend-users’\\n behaviors,  all  of  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted.  Moreover,  even  after  shelter  at  home  orders  and  travel  advisories  are  lifted,demand\\n for our Mobility offering may remain weak for a significant length of time and we cannot predict when and if our Mobility offering will return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels.\\nIn\\n addition, we cannot predict  the impact  the COVID-19 pandemic  will have on our business partners  and third-party  vendors, and we may be adverselyimpacted as\\n a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19pandemic\\n have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capitalmarkets.\\n To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the otherrisks\\n described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, couldadversely impact our busin\\ness, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.Operational Risks\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Driv\\ners were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.The\\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\\n or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.  We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other\\n things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, andprovide a vehicle to per\\nform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with\\n defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may con\\ntinue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drive\\nrs in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese\\n Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved\\n in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings,\\n this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condi\\ntion.Changes\\n to foreign,  state, and local laws governing the definition  or classification  of independent  contractors,  or judicial  decisions regarding  independentcontractor\\n classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers\\n by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought\\n litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral,\\n in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,\\n and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020,\\n the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe\\n pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court’s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the \\ninjunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In\\n November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours\\n for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independentcontractors\\n under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminar\\ny injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the ef\\nfective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We\\n face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging\\n that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay\\n be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,\\n we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated\\n with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity\\n contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however,\\n we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate\\n Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof\\n the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effec\\nt on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another\\n example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment\\n Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan\\n self-employed).  Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as “workers” under UK labor law, goingforward.\\n Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday\\n pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relatio\\nnship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme\\n Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions\\n by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish\\n regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the mea\\nning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In\\n addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming\\n represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number ofDrivers\\n were  to  become  unionized  and  collective  bargaining  agreement  terms  were  to  deviate  significantly  from  our  business  model,  our  business,  financialcondition,\\n operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disruptour operations and reduce our n\\net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.In\\n addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentationincluding\\n revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “CriticalAccounting\\n Estimates”  included  in  Part II,  Item  7  of this  Annual  Report on  Form  10-K and  Note  1 in  the  section  titled  “Notes  to  the Consolidated  FinancialStatements” included in Pa\\nrt II, Item 8 of this Annual Report14\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely i\\nmpacted.Our\\n platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly\\n fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada\\n from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto\\n entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift\\n to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants\\n have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and car\\nriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further,\\n while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona\\n limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan\\n we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition.\\n In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers\\n value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competitioncould\\n result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.\\nWe face competit\\nion in each of our offerings, including:•\\nMobility .  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets\\n that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition,\\n public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany\\n cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi jo\\nint venture.•\\nDelivery .

Further, some of our current or potential competitorshave, and\\n may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, shipper, or carrier bases in a particular geographicmarket.\\n In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operatinghistories,\\n larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respondmore\\n quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which mayrender\\n our products or offerings less attractive.

Our inability to compete effectively wouldhave an adverse effec\\nt on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.To\\n remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, andmay\\n continue to  offer,  significant  Driver incentives  and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely  affected  and may  continue to adverselyaffect our financial performance.\\nTo\\n remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or servicefees, and we have\\n offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,we\\n have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver\\n receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets andregions,\\n we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand\\n promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions\\n will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect,\\n our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have beenmodified\\n over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Driver\\ns. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see inthe\\n application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in \\nthe future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compet\\ne have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill\\n continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.  Moreover,  certain  of  our  stockholders,  including  SoftBank  (a  large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain\\n of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe\\n future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete moreeffectively\\n against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,\\n shippers,  and  carriers  to  their  platform  and  away  from  ours.  Such  competitive  pressures  may  lead  us  to  maintain  or  lower  fares  or  service  fees  ormaintain\\n or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relativelynascent, and we can\\nnot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.We\\n have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeabl\\ne future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating lo\\nsses of $8.6 billion, $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31,2019,\\n 2020 and 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $23.6 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levelsand\\n decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, wemay not be able to maintain\\n or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses,as we\\n continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,and\\n promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hireadditional employees; and\\n add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed inincreasing\\n our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increaserevenue or\\n contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect toadd\\n value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lowerservice\\n fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in anegative\\n take  rate  with  respect  to  those  transactions  after  considering  amounts  collected  from  consumers  and  paid  to  Drivers.

If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, orelect\\n to offer them through a competitor’s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform.

Inaddition,\\n if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptablemanner,\\n our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers do not establish ormaintain\\n active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-qualitysupport,\\n or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, our revenue would decline, and ourbusiness would suffer.\\nThe\\n number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide theirservices\\n through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms orservices,\\n and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or otheraspects\\n of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similarwork,\\n we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives toimprove our financial p\\nerformance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.Often,\\n we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likelybe\\n viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and securitybreaches,\\n including  terminating  access  to  our  platform  for  users  with  low  ratings  or  reported  incidents,  and  imposing  certain  qualifications  for  Drivers  andmerchants,\\n which  may  damage  our  relationships  with  platform  users  or  discourage  or  diminish  their  use  of  our  platform.  Further,  we  are  investing  in  ourautonomous\\n vehicle  strategy,  which  may  add  to  Driver  dissatisfaction  over  time,  as  it  may  reduce  the  need  for  Drivers.  Driver  dissatisfaction  has  in  the  pastresulted\\n in protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protestsmay\\n result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce ournetwork liquidity, and which in turn \\nmay cause a further decline in platform usage.17\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and cons\\numers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries\\n through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide\\n rides through our Mobility products.

Required  changes  in  the  qualification,  screening,  and  background  check  process  (including  anychanges\\n to  such  processes  of  Careem,  Postmates  or  other  acquired  companies)  could  also  reduce  the  number  of  Drivers  in  those  markets  or  extend  the  timerequired\\n to  recruit  new  Drivers  to  our  platform,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business  and  growth.  Furthermore,  we  rely  on  a  single  background-checkprovider in certain\\n jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms orat\\n all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Driversundergoing periodic background ch\\necks that are required to continue using our platform.Maintaining\\n and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  business  prospects.  We  have  previously  received  significant  media  coverage  andnegative\\n publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintainor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\nMaintaining\\n and  enhancing  our  brand  and  reputation  is  critical  to  our  ability  to  attract  new  employees  and  platform  users,  to  preserve  and  deepen  theengagement\\n of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverseplatform user sentiment.\\nWe\\n have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueleddistrust\\n of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made itdifficult\\n for  us  to  attract  and  retain  platform  users,  reduces  confidence  in  and  use  of  our  products  and  offerings,  invites  continued  legislative  and  regulatoryscrutiny,\\n and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,increased their inves\\ntments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.In 2019, we\\n released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to haveoccurred on\\n our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safetyincidents claimed to h\\nave occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continueto\\n result  in  positive  and  negative  media  coverage  and  increased  regulatory  scrutiny  and  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation  with  platform  users.  Furtherunfavorable\\n media  coverage  and  negative  publicity  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects.  As  our  platform  continues  to  scale  andbecomes\\n increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation couldhave\\n an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates andCornershop, have\\n or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harmto their brands could advers\\nely impact our brand and reputation.Our\\n brand  and  reputation  might  also  be  harmed  by  events  outside  of  our  control.  For  example,  we  have  licensed  our  brand  in  connection  with  certaindivestitures\\n and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certaincontractual\\n protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,and consumers may not be\\n aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice,\\n are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour\\n reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.\\nWhile\\n we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood\\n reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quali\\nty of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia\\n strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and  potential  competitors  will  expand  theirofferings,\\n which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.

Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally.\\n Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote\\n transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospe\\ncts.Our historical\\n workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies\\n in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay\\n not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged\\n to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not b\\ne successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and\\n operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare\\n unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely af\\nfected.Since\\n our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas\\n placed,  and  will  continue  to  place,  significant  strain  on  our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal\\n financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affectour operating results.\\nAs\\n our  operations  have  expanded,  we  have  grown  from  159  employees  as  of  December  31,  2012  to  approximately  29,300  global  employees  as  ofDecember\\n 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Pr\\noperly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including\\n engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires\\n perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and\\n staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce\\n and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin\\n workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the\\n distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor\\n us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.  Properlymanaging\\n our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so couldlikewise harm our business.\\nOur\\n failure  to  upgrade  our  technology  or  network  infrastructure  effectively  to  support  our  growth  could  result  in  unanticipated  system  disruptions,  slowresponse times,\\n or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improvethe\\n technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controlsover\\n financial  reporting,  we  will  be  required  to  commit  substantial  financial,  operational,  and  technical  resources.  In  particular,  we  will  need  to  improve  ourtransaction\\n processing  and  reporting,  operational,  and  financial  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  For  example,  due  to  our  significant  growth,  especially  withrespect to\\n our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolvingrisks\\n of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our currentand\\n planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hireadditional\\n qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, orcarriers,\\n platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affectour business, financial condi\\ntion, and operating results.Our organizational structure is\\n complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, carriers, shippers, employees, productsand\\n offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as well asour\\n reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure.

Further,  the  qualification  and  background  check  standards  for  Couriers  are  generally  lessextensive\\n than those conducted for Mobility Drivers.

Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct whileusing\\n our platform,  Drivers  and merchants  may be unwilling  to continue using our platform.  In addition,  certain  regions  where we operate  have high rates  ofviolent\\n crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports ofDrivers\\n and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. Ifother\\n criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may beharmed, and our business and finan\\ncial results could be adversely affected.Public\\n reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,whether generated by us or thi\\nrd parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.Further,\\n we  may  be  subject  to  claims  of  significant  liability  based  on  traffic  accidents,  deaths,  injuries,  or  other  incidents  that  are  caused  by  Drivers,consumers,\\n or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, wemay\\n face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. Inaddition, the\\n growth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable roadusers\\n and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved oruneven\\n roadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitanareas, need\\n to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,all of which heighten the potential risk\\n of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which weare\\n exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase ouroperating\\n costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significantcosts in investigating and de\\nfending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may\\n increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherentlyrisky, and we may never realize any expec\\nted benefits from them.We have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologie\\ns, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing newtechnologies, tools,\\n features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in severalcountries including\\n Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an\\n on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. We also plan to invest significantresources\\n to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate.

Th\\nese risks include, among others:•\\noperational and compli ance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;•\\nthe  resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptationof our operations to local p\\nractices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;•\\nlaws  and  regulations  more  restrictive  than  those  in  the  United  States,  including  laws  governing  competition,  pricing,  payment  methods,  Internetactivities,\\n transportation  services  (such  as  taxis  and  vehicles  for  hire),  transportation  network  companies  (such  as  ridesharing),  logistics  services,payment\\n processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening andbackground\\n checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,ownership of intellectua\\nl property, and other activities important to our business;•\\ncompetition with companies or other  services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existingrelationships with potenti\\nal platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;•\\ndiffering levels of soc ial acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;•\\ndiffering levels of t echnological compatibility with our platform;•\\nexposure to business cultures in whi ch improper business practices may be prevalent;•\\nlegal  uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or alack of clear legal precedent;\\n•\\ndifficulties  in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of laborunions, employee represent\\native bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;•\\nfluctuations in curren cy exchange rates;•\\nmanaging operations in ma rkets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;•\\nregulations governing the  control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in thesame currencies, as wel\\nl as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;•\\nadverse  tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation ofearnings;\\n•\\nincreased financia l accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;21\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our growth strategyhas\\n also  included  the  divestment  of  certain  lines  of  businesses  in  its  entirety,  and  not  just  in  certain  jurisdictions,  and  instead  partnering  and  investing  in  ourcompetitors\\n in  those  lines  of  businesses.  As  a  result,  a  significant  portion  of  our  assets  includes  minority  ownership  positions,  including  in  Didi,  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lim\\ne, Zomato and Aurora.Our ownership\\n in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors ofDidi\\n or Zomato, and therefore we do not participate in the day-to-day management of Didi or Zomato or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi andZomato.\\n We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day\\n management  of  Grab,  our  Yandex.Taxi  joint  venture,  Lime  or  Aurora.  Although  we  are  represented  on  each  of  the  boards  of  directors  of  Grab,  ourYandex.Taxi\\n joint venture, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams ofthese\\n companies  may  make  decisions  or  take  actions  with  which  we  disagree  or  that  may  be  harmful  to  the  value  of  our  ownership  in  these  companies.Additionally, these\\n companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in variousmarkets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our owner\\nship interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results,and prospects would be adversely a\\nffected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.Any\\n material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of theseassets\\n is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affectsuch\\n valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies couldadversely\\n impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companieshave\\n limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limitedpublic information\\n is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particulareconomic,\\n tax, political,  legal, safety, regulatory  and public health risks, including the extent of the impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic  on their business; aredomiciled\\n or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and effortsof a small group of individuals, and, as a\\n result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect onthe\\n relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitivepositions.\\n Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operatingresults, or the trading pr\\nice of our common stock.Further,\\n we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial publicoffering, we\\n are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Other than Aurora, Grab, Didi and Zomato, there is currently no public market forany of these securities, and there may be no market\\n in the future if and when we decide to sell such assets. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at atime\\n at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment companyunder\\n the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we wouldnot\\n be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.Accordingly, we may never rea\\nlize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.We\\n may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors,\\n some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For\\n Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically\\n generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We\\n have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult\\n of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue\\n in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations;\\n however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery\\n in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto\\n detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal\\n trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of\\n factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand\\n our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith\\n technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation,\\n and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand\\n consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible\\n to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases\\n or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term o\\nr long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor\\n pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or\\n regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than\\n would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour\\n ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting\\n licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan\\n area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.\\nIn\\n addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe\\n number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment \\nformula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers\\n on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance\\n in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips\\n in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or\\n may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices\\n on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller\\n and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban\\n and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be \\nlimited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021,\\n we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, ouroperating\\n results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports.\\n In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom\\n airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility\\n and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating\\n that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing\\n operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite\\n permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or\\n Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.\\n In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees,\\n the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave\\n entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries,\\n we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airpor\\nts in all jurisdictions.If\\n we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those\\n offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be ad\\nversely impacted.We\\n have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform.\\n For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the\\n combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesh\\naring24\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired),\\n Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey\\n will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing\\n fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous\\n vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their tech\\nnology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith\\n which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould\\n adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing,\\n delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers\\n on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.\\nAutonomous vehicle technologies \\ninvolve significant risks and liabilities.

Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace\\n practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our\\n employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our “return to office” plan,which\\n includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin\\ng our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability toattract\\n employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remotework,\\n as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand\\n feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.  Future  challenges  related  to  our  culture  and  workplace  practices  oradditional negative publicit\\ny could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.Future\\n leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of seniormanagement or other employee\\n turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives andemployees required for \\nthe planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.In\\n addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We haveentered\\n into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.

If  we  are  unable  to  attract  and  retain  high-quality  management  and  operating  personnel,  ourbusiness, financial condit\\nion, and operating results could be adversely affected.The impact of economic conditions, inc\\nluding the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.Our\\n performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic condition\\ns, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,\\n taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives\\n during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone\\n of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation\\n alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand\\n may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants\\n in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is gene\\nrally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany\\n of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand\\n offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportuni\\nties for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inf\\nlation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors\\n such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle\\n parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,\\n factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant\\n operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the\\n control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek\\n alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause\\n order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson\\n our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,which could harm our business and oper\\nating results.If\\n we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee da\\nta, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We\\n collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers’ licensenumbers\\n and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are anattractive\\n target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,alteration or\\n destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation andbrand,\\n a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwiseprocess\\n some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,acquisition, disclosure, a\\nlteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.Because\\n the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizableuntil\\n launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may bevulnerable\\n to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measuresmay\\n misappropriate  confidential,  proprietary,  or  personal  information  held  by  or  on  behalf  of  us,  disrupt  our  operations,  damage  our  computers,  or  otherwisedamage\\n our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,including potential li\\nability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.Security\\n breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmentalinvestigation.\\n We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future.

As  we  expand  our  operations,  we  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breaches  experienced  by  the  companies  we  acquire.  Forexample, in\\n April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto\\n certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity\\n breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant \\nliabilities.If\\n we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operat\\ning results would be adversely affected.To\\n continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new\\n products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in\\n January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider\\n destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independenc\\ne of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing\\n and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends\\n on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew\\n or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges\\n in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and\\n adverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, orif\\n platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which wouldadversely affect our op\\nerating results.We\\n track  certain  operational  metrics  and  our  category  position  with  internal  systems  and  tools,  and  our  equity  stakes  in  minority-owned  affiliates  withinformation\\n provided  by  such  minority-owned  affiliates,  and  do  not  independently  verify  such  metrics.  Certain  of  our  operational  metrics  are  subject  toinherent challenges in measurement, and real or perce\\nived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.We\\n track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems andtools,\\n and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by anythird\\n party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions onwhich\\n we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which couldresult\\n in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and toolswe\\n use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. Whilethese\\n numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges inmeasuring\\n how  our  products  are  used  across  large  populations  globally.  For  example,  we  believe  that  there  are  consumers  who  have  multiple  accounts,  eventhough\\n we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to howwe\\n measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-termstrategies. If our operating metrics\\n or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations ofour\\n business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to beaccurate,\\n or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial resultscould be adversely affected.\\nIn\\n certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, andsafety concerns. If we do not succes\\nsfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and\\n Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers\\n to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accoun\\nted for approximately 7% of our global27\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology\\n raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing\\n and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines\\n and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash\\n with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other\\n criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing\\n our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our busin\\ness.In\\n addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue\\n to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash\\n received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways\\n effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Furt\\nher, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa\\n variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail,\\n we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection\\n failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.\\nLoss or material modification of our cr\\nedit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by eithe\\nr credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit\\n our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(“PCI”) and Data Security Standard\\n (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the\\n PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork\\n operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment cardnetwork\\n rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal\\n that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies,\\n such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standa\\nrd, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating\\n rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations\\n of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives\\n from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.  The  loss  of  our  credit  card  acceptance  privileges  for  any  one  of  thesereasons, or\\n the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue,and operating results.\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, spa\\nmming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.We\\n rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms andmobile\\n payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the informationtechnology systems of our\\n third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,including\\n sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,viruses,\\n spamming, and phishing have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreatsare\\n constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticatedcyberattacker, such as\\n a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security ofour\\n systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitiveposition,\\n result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adverselyaffect our reputat\\nion, business and operating results.Various other\\n factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,issues\\n with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, orbreaches\\n in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gainaccess\\n to our data or the data of platform users.

We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future thatcould\\n result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control,such\\n as outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platformusers\\n may experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, ourrelease\\n of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Anyerrors,\\n bugs,  or  vulnerabilities  discovered  in  our  code  or  systems  after  release  could  result  in  an  interruption  in  the  availability  of  our  platform  or  a  negativeexperience\\n for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to ourreputation,\\n loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness\\n and financial results. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks.AI\\n algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information.

Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and durationof\\n extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-partysuppliers,\\n and the business of merchants, shippers, carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs tomaintain\\n or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% ofvehicle\\n miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Driversmay be\\n subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adoptedin\\n London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent weexperience Driver supply cons\\ntraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.We\\n have  made  climate  related  commitments  that  require  us  to  invest  significant  effort,  resources,  and  management  time  and  circumstances  may  arise,including those beyond our control, that may require us to revis\\ne the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.We\\n have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to netzero\\n climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040.

For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities acrossthird-party\\n apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness ofsuch\\n advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users onour platform.\\n We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is criticalto\\n the functionality of our platform.

We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it ispossible\\n that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do notprovide access to such softwar\\ne on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we maybe\\n required  to  seek  comparable  software  from  other  sources,  which  may  be  more  expensive  or  inferior,  or  may  not  be  available  at  all,  any  of  which  wouldadversely affect our bus\\niness.Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across de\\nvices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.One\\n of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.

These third-party  operations  and  co-located  datacenters\\n may experience  break-ins,  computer  viruses, denial-of-service  attacks,  sabotage,  acts of vandalism,  and other misconduct.  These facilities  may also bevulnerable\\n to  damage  or  interruption  from  power  loss,  telecommunications  failures,  fires,  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  and  similar  events.  Oursystems\\n do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party serviceproviders\\n to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or requireus\\n to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss ofdata, any of\\n which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switchto\\n another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference  to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data centerproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and o\\nur co-located data center facilitieshave\\n no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities oncommercially\\n reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center isarranged.\\n Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and carriers to stop offering their servicesthrough\\n our  platform,  and  reduce  use  of  our  platform  by  consumers  and  shippers.  Our  business  and  operating  results  may  be  harmed  if  current  and  potentialDrivers,\\n consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computationalcapacity\\n sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,which would have an adverse effe\\nct on our growth and business.Our use of third-party open source software could adversely a\\nffect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.We\\n use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open sourcesoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source soft\\nware and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may besubject\\n to  suits  by  parties  claiming  ownership  of  what  we  believe  to  be  open  source  software,  or  claiming  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  open  sourcelicensing\\n terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open sourcesoftware to make available\\n all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designedto monitor our\\n compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource\\n license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms\\n of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source\\n software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation\\n of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain po\\nrtions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In\\n addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source\\n licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.  Use  of  open  source  software  may  also  presentadditional security risks because the public availability of such soft\\nware may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise ourplatform.\\n Additionally,  because  any  software  source  code  that  we  make  available  under  an  open  source  license  or  that  we  contribute  to  existing  open  sourceprojects becomes public\\nly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we31\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Certain  of  our  existing  debtinstruments\\n contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness andother\\n financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, ourexisting\\n debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financingon\\n favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to supportour business growth and to respond to business ch\\nallenges and competition may be significantly limited.We\\n have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness maylimit the funds available to us, and the ter\\nms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.As\\n of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4 billion aggregate principal amount.

In particular, we may needto incur additional debt \\nto finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.We\\n may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments willreduce\\n the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing forworking\\n capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten ourvulnerability\\n to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe\\n industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cashflow\\n from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness,or\\n to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generatecash from operating ac\\ntivities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.In\\n addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,including\\n limitations  on  incurring  additional  indebtedness  and  liens,  limitations  on  certain  consolidations,  mergers,  and  sales  of  assets,  and  restrictions  on  thepayment\\n of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raisingactivities\\n and  other  financial  and  operational  matters,  which  may  make  it  more  difficult  for  us  to  obtain  additional  capital  to  pursue  business  opportunities,including\\n potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit ourability to obtain addit\\nional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.In addition, we are exposed to\\n interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled “Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condit\\nion and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”We may have exposure to materiall\\ny greater than anticipated tax liabilities.The\\n tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies.

Furthermore, our futureincome\\n taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions\\n that have higher  statutory  tax rates,  changes in the valuation  allowance  on our U.S. and Netherlands'  deferred  tax assets, or changes  in tax laws,regulations, or accounting p\\nrinciples. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, andcurrently\\n face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition\\n and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertai\\nn. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts\\n recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax\\n positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which\\n could  impact  our  financial  position.  In  addition,  in  connection  with  any  planned  or  future  acquisitions,  we  may  acquire  businesses  that  have  differinglicenses\\n and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than ourlicenses\\n and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions\\n or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adve\\nrsely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely aff\\nect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We\\n are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020,\\n has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remainunclear\\n in  many  respects  and  could  be  subject  to  potential  amendments  and  technical  corrections,  as  well  as  interpretations  and  incremental  implementingregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the\\n “IRS”), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. Inaddition,\\n it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting poi\\nnt for computing state and local tax liabilities.We\\n are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness.\\n Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat\\n we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stock\\nholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potentialchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations\\n, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We couldbecome\\n subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmentalbodies\\n could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted andhistorically\\n applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our taxobligations\\n in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expandingscale\\n of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ourfinancial position, oper\\nating results, and cash flows.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other \\ntax attributes may be limited.As\\n of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes of $14.9 billion and$12.4\\n billion, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January1,\\n 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,we\\n also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards\\n depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome\\n tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  In  addition,  under  Sections  382  and  383  of  the  IRC, if  a  corporationundergoes\\n an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’sability\\n to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset itspost-change\\n income may be limited.  Many U.S. states follow similar  rules for restricting  use of tax attributes  after  an ownership change.

As  exchange  rates  vary,  revenue,  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  ofdepreciation\\n and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affectour\\n overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activitymay not\\n completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we havelimited\\n experience  establishing  hedging  programs,  which  could  expose  us  to  additional  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  operatingresults.\\nIf\\n we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesseswe acquire may not perform as expected or b\\ne effectively integrated.As\\n part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divestportions or aspects of our business, s\\nell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including ourYandex.Taxi\\n joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,Drizly and\\n Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify atarget\\n for  acquisition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  acquisition  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  receive  approval  from  theapplicable competi\\ntion authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.Further,\\n negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We\\n may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable\\n cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.  In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities,\\n which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluateand\\n execute  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  successfully  or  fail  to  successfully  address  any  of  these  risks,  our  business,  financial  condition,  andoperating results may be h\\narmed.In\\n addition,  any  businesses  we  acquire  may  not  perform  as  well  as  we  expect.  Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies,\\n including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion\\n prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policiesregarding\\n data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, anddoing\\n so  may  cause  our  relationships  with  government  authorities  in  certain  jurisdictions  to  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessingsignificant\\n fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquiredcompany, business, or technology or a\\ncquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:•\\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;•\\ndisrupting our ongoing business operat ions;•\\nplatform user accep tance of the acquired company’s offerings;•\\nimplementing or rem ediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;•\\nintegrating the acqui red business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;•\\nretaining  and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing culturaldifferences\\n between  acquired  businesses  and  our  business,  as  well  as  managing  costs  associated  with  eliminating  redundancies  or  transferringemployees on acceptabl\\ne terms with minimal business disruption;•\\nmaintaining importan t business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;•\\nintegrating the brand id entity of an acquired company with our own;•\\nintegrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;•\\nliability for pre- acquisition activities of the acquired company;•\\nlitigation or other c laims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and•\\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.We have in the past and may \\nin the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions.

Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not proveeffective, and such par\\nties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.We\\n may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will beaccretive\\n to  the  value  of  our  common  stock.

In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going\\n basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,”including with\\n respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt\\n granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which\\n we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability\\n to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,\\n and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities\\n to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity’s\\n Secretaría  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition\\n on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Driv\\ners in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we\\n have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such \\nregulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab \\nand car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto\\n comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019,\\n we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked\\n up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented\\n a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew\\n York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave\\n had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted\\n to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle\\n licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust\\n 2019, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new “cruisingcap,”\\n intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although\\n such “cruising cap” was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measur\\ne to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton\\n January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition,\\n in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1,\\n 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate\\n for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United St\\nates.

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations\\n altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness\\n operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused\\n the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges\\n and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial\\n performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat\\n we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in\\n Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain\\n of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings\\n or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue\\n operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice\\n and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses\\n or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue\\n to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas\\n a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers’  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore,\\n such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely\\n affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave\\n favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In\\n addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing\\n with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our\\n business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and oth\\ner requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an advers\\ne impact on our business and future prospects.As\\n of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflict\\ning, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,regional,\\n and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our businessmodel.\\n Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting howwe\\n operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may beadopted.\\nFurther,\\n existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws andregulations,\\n and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medicaltransportation, we\\n may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market\\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit\\n or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are activelychallenging\\n some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further,\\n because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or\\n emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for\\n polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effectin April\\n 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto\\n electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California tohave\\n been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require usto share\\n certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordancewith\\n these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt oneither a temporary o\\nr indefinite basis.Additionally, effectiv\\ne January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (“EU”), an event commonly36\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.In\\n addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe\\n application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers,\\n including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,\\n among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability,\\n discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of\\n Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof\\n Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegatio\\nns, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial\\n damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould\\n harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,revenue, and operating resu\\nlts.In\\n addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters throug\\nh our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery\\n and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan\\n that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app coul\\nd result in negativepublicity, market withdr\\nawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competit\\nion laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition\\n authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, incl\\nuding governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues\\n of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof\\n anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo\\n high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour\\n business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether o\\nr not valid or subject to appeal.In\\n addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose\\n significant  fines or penalties,  require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions  that limit or require  us to modify our operations,including\\n limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we dobusiness\\n and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financialcondition, or operating resu\\nlts.We\\n expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focuson\\n the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of aninvestigation\\n or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limitour future acquisitions, div\\nestitures, operations and growth.Our business is subject to extensive government regula\\ntion and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.Most\\n jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine thatcertain\\n aspects  of our business are  subject to these laws and could require  us to obtain licenses  to continue  to operate  in such jurisdictions.  For example,  oursubsidiary\\n in  the  Netherlands,  Uber  Payments  B.V.,  is  registered  and  authorized  by  its  competent  authority,  De  Nederlandsche  Bank,  as  an  electronic  moneyinstitution.\\n This  authorization  permits  Uber  Payments  B.V.  to  provide  payment  services  (including  acquiring  and  executing  payment  transactions  and  moneyremittances,\\n as  referred  to  in  the  Revised  Payment  Services  Directive  (2015/2366/EU))  and  to  issue  electronic  money  in  the  Netherlands.

Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers,\\n merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in \\ncertain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users wit\\nh payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong\\n Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach\\n payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform\\n user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform\\n or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and\\n prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting\\n all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived\\n by those users. A substantial  increase  in the frequency  with which we make Driver payments  without having received  corresponding  payments fromconsumers could adversely a\\nffect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.In\\n addition,  laws  related  to  money  transmission  and  online  payments  are  evolving,  and  changes  in  such  laws  could  affect  our  ability  to  provide  paymentprocessing\\n on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combinedwith\\n changes  to  the  EU  Payment  Services  Directive,  caused  aspects  of  our  payment  operations  in  the  EEA  to  fall  within  the  scope  of  European  paymentsregulation.\\n As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-moneylaundering,\\n terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. EffectiveJuly\\n 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by theEuropean payments regulat\\nions.In\\n addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to moneytransmission,\\n online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic fundstransfers,\\n anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and exportrestrictions.\\n Our  business  operations,  including  our  payments  to  Drivers  and  merchants,  may  not  always  comply  with  these  financial  laws  and  regulations.Historical\\n or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,or\\n other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits onour ability to expand our produc\\nt offerings, could harm our business.Further,\\n our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,and\\n payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money launderingand\\n sanctions  laws,  and  in  the  EEA  to  conduct  appropriate  risk  assessments  and  implement  appropriate  controls  as  a  regulated  financial  service  provider.Government\\n authorities  may  seek  to  bring  legal  action  against  us  if  our  payment  system  is  used  for  improper  or  illegal  purposes  or  if  our  enterprise  riskmanagement or\\n controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to ourbusiness.\\nWe\\n currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”) offices and otherU.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes o\\nf which could harm our business.We\\n are  the  subject  of  DOJ  criminal  and  civil  inquiries  and  investigations,  as  well  as  civil  enforcement  inquiries  and  investigations  by  other  governmentagencies,\\n including state AG offices in the United States and abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including our businesspractices,\\n such as fees, pricing, and related disclosures, as well as data deletion and document retention policies related to the 2016 Breach, which involved thebreach\\n of certain archived consumer data hosted on a cloud-based service that outside actors accessed and downloaded. We have in the past and may in the future,settle\\n claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys\\n General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour\\n failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach andthe\\n 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December2018,\\n U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue\\n to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines\\n and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued aproposed\\n $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport.

Investigations and enforcement actionsfrom such entities, as wel\\nl as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users’ trust, could severely disrupt our business.We\\n are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and othercountries.\\nThese\\n government  inquiries  and  investigations  are  time-consuming  and  require  a  great  deal  of  financial  resources  and  attention  from  us  and  our  seniormanagement.\\n If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced tochange\\n our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additionalreputational\\n harm,  and  could  result  in  or  complicate  other  inquiries,  investigations,  or  lawsuits  from  other  regulators  in  future  merger  control  or  conductinvestigations. Any of these deve\\nlopments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.We\\n face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,legislative and regulatory act\\nion, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.The\\n nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.These\\n and any future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international  privacy, data protection, and other laws. Suchviolations\\n subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatoryentities\\n in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been thesubject\\n of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuantto\\n which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how weprotect\\n consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,future\\n failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately$1.6\\n million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with theOffice\\n of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulatedjudgments\\n with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 millionand\\n assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,enforcement\\n actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced\\n by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities\\n that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14,\\n 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat\\n Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed \\nand may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This\\n risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally,\\n we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security. The EU adopted the GDP\\nR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers\\n and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal\\n data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal\\n data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR\\n further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories\\n of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual\\n decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming\\n our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties,\\n including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside\\n the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California \\nConsumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew\\n operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst\\n businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states\\n have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides\\n another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These\\n laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (“CPRA”)\\n39\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and \\njudicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy\\n of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If\\n we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal\\n data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be\\n required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor\\n obtaining or maintaining  a license  or otherwise, from law enforcement  agencies,  and from intelligence  agencies.  This disclosure  may result in a failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, n\\notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe\\n same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain\\n government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and\\n ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto\\n suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem’s  app  on  either  atemporary\\n or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to co\\nmply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and off\\nerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such\\n data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance\\n requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure,\\n and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure\\n by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals,\\n consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound\\n liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were \\nto occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse\\n litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.\\nWe\\n have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings\\n by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We aresubject\\n to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectualproperty\\n infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any suchlitigation,\\n investigations,  and  legal  proceedings  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  expensive.  Any  claims  against  us,  whether  meritorious  or  not,  could  be  timeconsuming,\\n costly,  and  harmful  to  our  reputation,  and  could  require  significant  amounts  of  management  time  and  corporate  resources.  If  any  of  these  legalproceedings\\n were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced tochange the way in which we operate ou\\nr business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\\n addition,  we  regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our  terms  of  service  with  end-users.  These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess\\n for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration maybecome more\\n costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks\\n to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe\\n future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour\\n litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.  For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform use\\nrs and employees.Further,\\n with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween\\n state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection.\\n If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould\\n experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adve\\nrsely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich\\n we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion,\\n and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportati\\non company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay\\n adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number oflicensed\\n Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were\\n adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limi\\ntations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liabil\\nity for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We\\n operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers\\n may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs\\n against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver p\\nrogram without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we\\n settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with\\n this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,\\n and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.\\n In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.\\nOur\\n business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers\\n change the terms  of such insurance in a manner not favorable  to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to compl\\ny with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We\\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour\\n Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage.\\n We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited\\n number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee\\n that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all.

Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses\\n for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data.\\n While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves.\\n We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on ou\\nr unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We\\n may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse\\n our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings\\n on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability\\n insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to\\n have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot\\n result  in  liability,  we could incur  significant  costs in investigating  and defending  against  them.  If insurers  become  insolvent,  they may not be  able  to payotherwise\\n valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may besubject to negative publi\\ncity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.In\\n addition,  we  are  subject  to  local  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  relating  to  insurance  coverage  which  could  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  us  bygovernmental\\n entities  or  others.  Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional\\n legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders\\n and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\\n us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings\\n or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to in\\ncrease our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulat\\nions, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue\\n is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen,\\n and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer\\n fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further,\\n in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional\\n regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject\\n of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including\\n rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number ofmunicipalities\\n have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As aresult, we may be forced to \\nchange our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.If\\n we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property ofothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be advers\\nely affected.Our\\n intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardwaredesigns,\\n registered  and  unregistered  trademarks,  trademark  applications,  copyrights,  trade  secrets,  inventions  (whether  or  not  patentable),  patents,  and  patentapplications.

Further, certain adverseoutcomes of such proceedings cou\\nld adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.We\\n may  be  required  or  may  opt  to  seek  a  license  for  the  right  to  use  intellectual  property  held  by  others,  which  may  not  be  available  on  commerciallyreasonable\\n terms,  or  at  all.

We may\\n also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effortand\\n expense  and  make  us  less  competitive.  If  we  cannot  license  or  develop  alternative  technology,  content,  branding,  or  business  methods  for  any  allegedlyinfringing\\n aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions.

We believe that\\n we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an “investment company” underthe\\n Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China),\\n referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe\\n are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment\\n company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment\\n Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse\\n effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements\\n of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon \\nthe sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe\\n market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and\\n we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof\\n our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably li\\nkely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The\\n process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging,\\n and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand\\n complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the \\nevaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we \\nwill be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We\\n cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings\\n (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal\\n control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude\\n that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness\\n in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice\\n of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor\\n other regulatory authorities.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod\\n 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim\\n alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain\\n taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and in\\ntend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal Proceedings\\nWhile\\n it is not possible to determine  the outcome  of the legal  actions,  investigations,  and proceedings  brought against  us, we believe  that,  except for thematters\\n described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial\\n to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged\\n market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial\\n position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities’  and  states’declarations\\n of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave,\\n and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore,\\n we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns reg\\narding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response Initiatives\\nWe continue to priorit\\nize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe\\n will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving\\n our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the gro\\nwth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, s\\nervices or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To\\n comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost\\n markets, and implemented “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.\\nAs\\n vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer\\n demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve dri\\nver availability in the near-term.While\\n we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash\\n flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves\\n or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions\\n that  may be taken  by governmental  authorities,  the further  impact  on the business of Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and business partners,  and otherfactors identified \\nin Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification Developments\\nThe\\n classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved\\n in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative\\n agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers\\n or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020,\\n the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior\\n Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused\\n by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Foll\\nowing a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe\\n preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for \\nindependent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’spreliminary\\n injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.\\nIn\\n January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which\\n was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition\\n 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Servic\\nes has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we\\n have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor\\n for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financia\\nl position, or cash flows.Also\\n of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against usasserting that they should be \\nclassified as “workers” (a separate category between independent49\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas\\n switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We app\\nealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On\\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme  Court of the UK upheld the tribunal  ruling. Subsequently, we initiated  a historical  claims  settlement  process for UKdrivers. Damages may includ\\ne back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate act\\nion to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we annou\\nnced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith\\n Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proa\\nctively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment impleme\\nntation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed\\n that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions\\n unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligib\\nle drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our\\n portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all d\\nrivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We\\n are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for cl\\naimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands \\ncourt ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If,\\n as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould\\n incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum\\n wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.\\n Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,and\\n we  may  not  be  able  to  hire  a  majority  of  the  Drivers  currently  using  our  platform.  Any  of  these  events  could  negatively  impact  our  business,  result  ofoperations, financial pos\\nition, and cash flows.For\\n a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operatingcondition\\n and  cash  flows,  see  the  risk  factor  titled  “-Our  business  would  be  adversely  affected  if  Drivers  were  classified  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees”\\n included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in PartII, Item 8, “Financial St\\natements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\\n addition,  if  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  this  may  impact  our  current  financial  statement  presentation  including  revenue,  cost  ofrevenue,\\n incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to theconsolidated\\n financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  “Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,”  and  the  section  titled  “Critical  AccountingEstimates” in Part II, \\nItem 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.50\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated\\n to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand\\n related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other terminatio\\nn benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These\\n activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the\\n largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability\\n to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter\\n 2020 planned cost structure.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users\\n to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance oblig\\nation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment\\n is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand\\n are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave\\n concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.\\n The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drive\\nrs and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In\\n certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst\\n any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for ca\\nsh trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver Incentives\\nWe\\n offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers\\n are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered i\\nn exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and Promotions\\nWe\\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification\\n of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a r\\neduction of revenue.Business Combinations\\nWe\\n allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair\\n values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations\\n require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible\\n assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and\\n trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.\\nManagement's\\n estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,\\n actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired\\n finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During\\n the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset \\nto goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Embedded Derivatives\\nDuring\\n 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed ofconversion\\n options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the totalnumber\\n of shares  of our common  stock delivered  to settle  these embedded  features  will have a fixed value.  These conversion options are  bifurcated  from  theunderlying\\n instrument  and  accounted  for  and  valued  separately  from  the  host  instrument.  Embedded  derivatives  are  recognized  as  derivative  liabilities  on  ourconsolidated\\n balance  sheet.  We  measure  these  instruments  at  their  estimated  fair  value  and  recognize  changes  in  their  estimated  fair  value  in  other  income(expense), net in our consolid\\nated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.We\\n value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial PublicOffering (“QIPO”) conversion option \\n(“QIPO Conversion Option”).

For additionalinformation,\\n refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form10-K.\\nInvestments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe\\n hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which wedo not\\n have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare\\n subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments\\n in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe\\n changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equi\\nty securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments\\n in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requiresjudgment\\n due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair\\n value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the\\n investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt secur\\nities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We\\n assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities\\n includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity\\n investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated\\n statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized\\n cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference\\n between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof\\n the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered\\n in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof\\n the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe\\n present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related\\n impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet\\n with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome\\n (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowanc\\ne for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\\nWe\\n account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not\\n a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, werecognize\\n through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ netincome or\\n loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter inarrears.\\n Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected inearnings.\\nWe\\n review  our  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  business  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of  theinvestment\\n may  not  be  fully  recoverable.  Qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  considered  as  indicators  of  a  potential  impairment  include  financial  results  andoperating trends of the inv\\nestees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding theinvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment woul\\nd have to be determinedand an\\n impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment.

We record a liability whenwe\\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to changebased on new information and futu\\nre events.The\\n outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst\\n us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reportingperiod in which any such outcome be\\ncomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.Income Taxes\\nWe\\n are  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  United  States  and  foreign  jurisdictions.  We  account  for  income  taxes  using  the  asset  and  liability  method.  Theestablishment\\n of  deferred  tax  assets  from  intra-entity  transfers  of  intangible  assets  requires  management  to  make  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  todetermine the\\n fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the\\n estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are\\n derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although\\n we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal andexternal\\n comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of suchassumptions, estimates or \\nactual results.We\\n account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will besustained\\n upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require makingjudgments,\\n assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final taxoutcome\\n of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To theextent\\n that the final tax outcome of these matters  is different  than the amounts recorded,  such differences  may impact the provision for income taxes and theeffective tax ra\\nte in the period in which such determination is made.The\\n provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,we are\\n subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularlyassess the likelihood of adve\\nrse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs,\\n as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting\\n condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority\\n of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. Th\\ne market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We\\n account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards,\\n which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they o\\nccur.We\\n have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inp\\nuts and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock pr\\nice volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black\\n-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:•\\nExpected term. We estimate the exp ected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.•\\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.•\\nExpected volatility.  We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility ofour\\n own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we cons\\nider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.•\\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is z ero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.We\\n continue  to  use  judgment  in  evaluating  the  expected  volatility  and  expected  term  utilized  in  our  stock-based  compensation  expense  calculation  on  aprospective\\n basis.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe\\n are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur\\n exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025\\n and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour\\n consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest\\n rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of\\n our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin\\n periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.\\nInvestment Risk\\nOur\\n investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including\\n restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid\\n not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds\\n and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk.\\n Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would n\\not have a material effect on our financial results.We\\n are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently\\n public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue\\n given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments\\n in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe\\n fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time afte\\nr a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency Risk\\nWe\\n transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe\\n risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses\\n denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating\\n results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geogr\\naphic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We\\n have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our\\n asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates\\n may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other f\\ninancial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control overfinancial\\n reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)(PCAOB)\\n and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  andregulations of the Securi\\nties and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We\\n conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance\\n about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  error  or  fraud,  and  whether  effective  internalcontrol over financial reporti\\nng was maintained in all material respects.Our\\n audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,\\n whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidenceregarding\\n the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significantestimates\\n made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financialreporting\\n included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  andevaluating\\n the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in th\\ne circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As\\n described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (“Drizly”) and TupeloParent, Inc. (“Transplace”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 3\\n1, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company inpurchase\\n business combinations during 2021.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe\\n consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the\\n accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and De\\nlivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs\\n described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of theCompany’s\\n platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users\\n for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent\\n in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation\\n of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended\\n December  31,  2021,  the  Company’s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided \\nto end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The\\n principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives,\\n discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation\\n of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which\\n in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were a\\nppropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing\\n the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.\\n These procedures  included testing  the effectiveness  of controls  relating  to the Company’s revenue recognition  process, including  controls over thepresentation of Mobility \\nand Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes\\n and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements,\\n rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\\nAs\\n described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of\\n the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor\\n losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied\\n to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss developmentpatterns\\n and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  bymanagement\\n and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  new  information  becomes  known.  The  Company’s  short-term  and  long-term  insurance  reserves  as  ofDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 bil\\nlion.The\\n principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  valuation  of  insurance  reserves  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  thesignificant\\n judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivityand\\n effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  the  actuarial  methods  and  management’s  significant  assumptions  related  to  lossdevelopment patterns and \\nexpected loss costs.

(“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa\\n technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber\\n develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connectsconsumers\\n (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(“Eaters”)\\n with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively,  “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery andother\\n delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas\\n “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shipp\\ners with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our\\n technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe\\n accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(“GAAP”).\\n We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”)where\\n we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  –  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been e\\nliminated.Use of Estimates\\nThe preparation\\n of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, an\\nd other assumptions whichmanagement\\n believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments\\n and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired\\n intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain\\n deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could\\n differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain\\n of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments\\n and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial\\n markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial perfor\\nmance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit Risk\\nCash\\n and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit\\n risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency\\n securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial\\n issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high creditquality.\\n We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld\\n by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited\\n number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment serviceproviders\\n are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\\nWe\\n have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.  Our  operations  havehistorically\\n been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolvingcredit\\n facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,additional capital may\\n need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives.

COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented\\n, including business activities and travelrestrictions,\\n and  “shelter-at-home”  orders,  that  have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business  and  operations  by  reducing,  in  particular,  the  global  demand  forMobility\\n offerings,  while  accelerating  the  growth  of  our  Delivery  offerings.  In  light  of  the  evolving  nature  of  COVID-19  and  the  uncertainty  it  continues  toproduce\\n around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results ofoperations,\\n financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture\\n developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the\\n outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets;\\n governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain \\nand cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash\\n and  cash equivalents  consist  of  cash held  in checking  and savings  accounts  as  well as  investments  in  money market  funds, commercial  paper,  U.S.government\\n and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.  We  consider  all  highly-liquid  investments  purchased  with  an  original  or  remaining  maturity  of  threemonths\\n or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, whichare included in accru\\ned and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash\\n and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies andalso\\n include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents areclassified\\n as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalentsand restricted cash and \\ncash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):As of December 31,\\n2019\\n2020 2021 Cash and cash equivalents\\n$ 10,873 $ 5,647 $ 4,295 Restricted cash and cash equ\\nivalents - current99 250 631 Restricted cash and cash equ\\nivalents - non-current1,095 1,494 2,879 Total cash and cash equival\\nents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$ 12,067 $ 7,391 $ 7,805 Collateral Held by Insurer\\nCollateral\\n held by insurer  represents  funds held by James  River Group companies  (“James  River”).  These funds, previously held in a trust  account,  werewithdrawn by James River during the fourth\\n quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to oneof\\n our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary’s current and future claim settlement obligations under theindemnification agreements\\n for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet . Accordingly, the amount withdrawn is presented as collate\\nral held by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet  as of December 31, 2020. During the third quarter of 2021\\n, in connection with the lega cy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented ascollateral\\n held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral  held by insurer tonon-current restric\\nted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance she et as of December 31, 2021.Legacy Auto Insurance Transfer\\nOn September\\n 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement(the\\n “LPTA”) with James  River effective  July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurancerisks\\n relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in theamount of $345 million (“Premium”). Subsequent to\\n the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risktransfer\\n arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator forongoing\\n handling (the “Transferred Claims”) at our expense.

We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.\\nWe\\n determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits\\n from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset\\n which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (“ROU”)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation\\n to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare\\n recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease\\n payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (“IBR”),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical\\n rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease\\n payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments\\n or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance,\\n utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.\\nOperating\\n leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance\\n sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance\\n sheets.

For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized\\n as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.

Thepurchase\\n price  of  the  acquisition  is  allocated  to  the  tangible  and  intangible  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair  values  at  theacquisition\\n date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one yearfrom the\\n acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusionof\\n the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded in the consolida\\nted statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 – Business Combinations for further information.Goodwill\\nGoodwill\\n represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting unitsexpected\\n to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes incircumstances\\n indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair\\n value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents\\n or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, afterassessing\\n the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impai\\nrment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The\\n quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be i\\nmpaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss\\n will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Our marketable equity securities inpublicly\\n traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investmentsin\\n non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions\\n for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable\\n equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable\\n equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue\\n on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment\\n at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but\\n would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant\\n adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or\\n a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  animpairment\\n exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment. We include \\ninvestments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.Debt Securities\\nAccounting\\n for  our  debt  securities  varies  depending  on  the  legal  form  of  the  security,  our  intended  holding  period  for  the  security,  and  the  nature  of  thetransaction.\\n Investments in debt securities are  classified as available-for-sale and are  initially recorded at  fair  value. Investments in marketable debt securitiesinclude\\n commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities\\n with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale\\n debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earn\\nings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As\\n of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone\\n year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale de\\nbt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-\\nfor-sale Debt SecuritiesWe\\n account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (“ASC  326”).  Weadopted\\n ASC  326  on  January  1,  2020,  on  a  modified  retrospective  basis.  Under  ASC  326,  at  each  reporting  period,  we  evaluate  our  available-for-sale  debtsecurities\\n at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstanceswhere\\n we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value andamortized\\n cost  is  recognized  as  a  loss  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  with  a  corresponding  write-down  of  the  security’s  amortized  cost.  Incircumstances\\n where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether acredit\\n loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings\\n actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows\\n of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value\\n and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net\\n income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements inexpected cash flows due to imp\\nrovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method Investments\\nInvestments\\n in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial\\n interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted forunder\\n the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to theinvestment\\n balance, our proportionate share of the investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results ofequity\\n method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations.

This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults\\n and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.\\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\\nWe\\n evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof\\n an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount\\n of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be re\\ncognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\\nFair\\n value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe\\n measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest pri\\nority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservabl\\ne inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quot\\ned prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\\n 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs \\nother than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which th\\nere is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our\\n primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-t\\nerm debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,\\n accounts  payable  and accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due to the short-term  maturities  of these instruments.  Refer  to Note 3 –Investments and Fair Value Me\\nasurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest Entities\\nWe\\n evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use\\n of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity\\n for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial\\n statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly\\n affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and (2)  has  the obligation  to  absorb losses  or  the right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially\\n be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether\\n we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with app\\nlicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.Revenue Recognition\\nWe\\n recognize  revenue  when  or  as  we  satisfy  our  obligations.  We  derive  our  revenues  principally  from  Drivers’  and  Merchants’  use  of  our  platform,  on-demand\\n lead generation,  and related  services,  including facilitating  payments from end-users. The service  enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive  andfulfill\\n on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the “Uber Service”). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we alsogenerate\\n revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fromcustomers' use of Freight serv\\nices.We periodically re\\nassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.87\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers\\n and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The\\n acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants \\nafter the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The\\n Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitat\\ne the completion of a successful transaction.In\\n 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers,\\n we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.\\n We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized \\ntotal revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally,\\n during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those\\n markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall\\n be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which\\n represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof\\n $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember\\n 31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these del\\nivery transactions.In all\\n markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not ou\\nr customers.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\\nJudgment is required in\\n determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof\\n revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for otherparties\\n to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promo\\ntions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For\\n the majority  of Mobility and Delivery transactions,  our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants  to facilitate  a successful  trip orDelivery\\n service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchaseor\\n otherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants toperform\\n the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-users.\\n As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsiblefor\\n Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobilityand\\n Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does notresult in us controlling th\\ne services provided to end-users.In\\n the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting  end-users seeking Mobility and Deliveryservices\\n with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a\\n net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing theservice\\n to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to providedelivery\\n services.  In  these  markets,  we  are  the  principal  for  the  Delivery  services  and  present  Delivery  revenue  on  a  gross  basis  because  we  are  primarilyresponsible for the servi\\nces.Mobility\\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Rider\\ns and successfullycomplete a trip via the Platf\\norm. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending\\n on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an\\n end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers,\\n end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.\\n Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of \\na trip.88\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Refer  to  Note  18  –  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation on the Transpl\\nace acquisition.Brokerage\\nBrokerage\\n revenue  represents  the  gross  amount  of  fees  charged  to  Shippers  for  our  services  because  we  control  the  service  provided  to  customers.  Costsincurred\\n with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.\\n We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the shipment  request  establishesenforceable\\n rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate\\n contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment\\n by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper’s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent\\n freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod\\n of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment \\nfor our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation Management\\nWe\\n provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation service\\ns. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese\\n services to transport the Shipper’s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a grossbasis\\n in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costsincurred\\n with  carriers  for  these  transactions  are  recorded  in  cost  of  revenue.  In  transactions  where  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  to  customers,  werecognize\\n revenue on a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin todestination\\n by a third-party carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are notmaterial. Payment fo\\nr our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.Principal vs. Agent Considerations\\nJudgment\\n is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered into with a Shipper wherewe\\n are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to theShipper.\\n We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrierthat\\n meets the Shipper's specifications. We also have pricing discretion and negotiate separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.Accordingly,\\n we are the principal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to customers and recognize the relatedrevenue on a net basis. Contracts where we do n\\not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years ended December 31, 2019,2020 and 2021.\\n89\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof\\n modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for\\n providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user’s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip.\\n After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 – Divestitures fo\\nr further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (“ATG”) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Rev\\nenueIn\\n 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next–generation self-driving technology.

Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration,\\n in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earn\\ned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring\\n new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense\\n such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC\\n 340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded\\n as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing\\n amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immateria\\nl.In\\n some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is re\\ncorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising Revenue\\nWe\\n derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized\\n when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in theamount billed to merchants\\n as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.End-User Discounts and Promotions\\nWe\\n offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discountsand promotions and include:\\nTargeted end-user\\n discounts and promotions: These  discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,or\\n generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or mealdeliveries\\n during a limited  time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers  as sales and marketingexpenses at the time th\\ney are redeemed by the end-user.End-user referrals:\\n These  referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platformand\\n the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referringend-user.\\n These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales andmarketing expenses at the\\n time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.Market-wide\\n promotions: These  promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants toend-users\\n who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under oursubscription\\n offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.Accordingly, we record the cost o\\nf these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.90\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Unanticipated  events  and  circumstances  may  occur  that  could  affect  either  the  accuracy  or  validity  of  suchassumptions, estimates or \\nactual results.Expenses\\nSet forth below is a brief des\\ncription of the components of our expenses:•\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily  consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,credit\\n card  processing  fees,  bank  fees,  data  center  and  networking  expenses,  mobile  device  and  service  costs,  costs  incurred  for  certain  Deliverytransactions where\\n we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided, costs incurred with carriers for Uber Freighttransportation servic\\nes, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.•\\nOperations and support expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations incities,\\n including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost ofcustomer support, Driver backg\\nround checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.•\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of co mpensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertisingcosts,\\n product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and theallocation\\n of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.3 billion,$1.0\\n billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, andcredits\\n provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.5 billion, $2.0 billion, and $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and2021, respectively.\\n•\\nResearch and development expenses primarily  consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, designand product development. Expenses inclu\\ndes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business inJanuary 2021, as\\n well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certaincorporate costs.\\n•\\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses primarily  consist  of  compensation  costs,  including  stock-based  compensation,  for  executive  management  andadministrative employees, including finance\\n and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as wellas\\n allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legalsettlements.\\n•\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily  consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,leasehold improvements, \\nfurniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.Restructuring and Related Charges\\nCosts\\n associated  with  management-approved  restructuring  activities,  including  reductions  in  headcount,  exiting  a  market  or  consolidation  of  facilities  arerecognized when\\n they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use\\n assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee terminationbenefits\\n either when it is probable that an employee is entitled  to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management hascommunicated\\n the termination  plan to employees  and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority  to approve the action,commits\\n to a plan of termination;  the plan identifies  the number of employees  to be terminated,  their job classifications  and their  locations,  and the expectedcompletion\\n date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefitsthey will receive if \\nthey are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will bemade\\n or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with thecontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remainin\\ng term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognizedat\\n the cease-use  date.  Costs associated  with lease  contracts  are  accounted  for under the leasing  accounting  guidance or under the long-lived  assets  accountingguidance.\\n93\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Monetary assetsand\\n liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate ineffect\\n at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement arerecorded\\n in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilitieswith\\n non-U.S.  dollar  functional  currencies  are  translated  at  the  month-end  rate,  retained  earnings  and  other  equity  items  are  translated  at  historical  rates,  andrevenues\\n and  expenses  are  translated  at  average  exchange  rates  during  the  year.  Cumulative  translation  adjustments  are  recorded  within  accumulated  othercomprehensive income (los\\ns), a separate component of total equity (deficit).Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nWe\\n compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available tocommon stockholders\\n for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as ifall income for the pe\\nriod had been distributed.Our restricted common stock, and\\n common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stockand\\n any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitabledividend rights in the event \\na cash dividend is declared on common stock.Prior\\n to  conversion  to  common  stock  upon  our  IPO,  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would  have  been  entitled  to  dividends  inpreference\\n to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restrictedcommon\\n stock,  common  stock  issued  upon  early  exercise  of  stock  options,  and  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  on  a  pro-rata  basisassuming\\n conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock. These participating securities did not contractually require the holders ofsuch shares to participa\\nte in our losses.Insurance Reserves\\nWe\\n use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance  mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for thepotential\\n liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers’compensation.\\n The  insurance  reserves  is  the  liability  for  unpaid  losses  and  loss  adjustment  expenses,  which  represents  the  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaidobligation\\n for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of thebalance\\n sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. Inaddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial\\n judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends,severity\\n trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.Adjustments, if\\n any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settledwithin\\n one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated balancesheets.\\nWhile\\n management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. Allestimates\\n of  ultimate  losses  and  allocated  loss  adjustment  expenses,  and  of  resulting  reserves,  are  subject  to  inherent  variability  caused  by  the  nature  of  theinsurance\\n claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend upon\\n the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and\\n social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from theestimate provided on the \\nconsolidated balance sheets.Loss Contingencies\\nWe\\n are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary\\n course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe\\n believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be \\nreasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.94\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This evaluation  consists of several factors  including, but not limited to, an assessment  of a significant adverse change in the economicenvironment,\\n significant  adverse changes in the general  market  condition  of the geographies  and industries  in which our investees  operate,  and other publiclyavailable\\n information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19,\\n we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carry\\ning value.To\\n determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted\\n at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities\\n within  the  investees’  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket\\n valuation declines of Didi’s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred\\n in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered\\n indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest\\n financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A\\n lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in th\\ne OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult\\n in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic\\n conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairm\\nent charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity owner\\nship interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise\\n significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V.

Call Option\\nThe\\n MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured\\n at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise\\n price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember\\n 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe\\n year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple\\n scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 y\\nears, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis Difference\\nIncluded\\n in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare\\n of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and\\n amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments represent\\ning fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the co\\nmposition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021\\nEquity method goodwill\\n$ 545 Intangible assets, net \\nof accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities\\n(12) Cumulative currency tr\\nanslation adjustments(107) Basis difference\\n$ 480 We\\n amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line\\n method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod\\n goodwill is not amortized. The investment balance  is reviewed for impairment  whenever factors indicate  that the carrying value of the equity methodinvestment\\n may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The futureeffect of the COVID-19 pandemic \\nand related government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.Mission Bay 3 & 4\\nThe\\n Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (“ECOP”), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies(“LLC\\n Partners”) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 millioncash\\n in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% asof December 31, 2020 and 2021.\\nIn\\n March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off theexisting construction\\n loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining  proceeds were distributed back toUber\\n and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, andreduced the investment \\ncarrying value by the same amount.We\\n have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter inarrears,\\n we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP’s income or loss, and any impairments, with a correspondingcredit\\n or  debit,  respectively,  to  income  or  loss  from  equity  method  investment,  net  of  tax  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  2019,  theconstruction\\n was completed and leasing activities commenced. and immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized during 2019, 2020 and 2021. During2020 and\\n 2021, we incurred an immaterial amount of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent\\n (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent\\n of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured\\n as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used th\\ne binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective\\n January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital\\n of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening\\n accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liabili\\nty measured at its amortized cost.The\\n fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered \\na Level 2 valuation input.Senior Notes\\nIn\\n October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) and eight-year\\n notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  “2026  Senior  Notes”)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.\\n We issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax\\n assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences\\n and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions\\n and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets,\\n our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax\\n assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable\\n to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and\\n tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an addi\\ntional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The\\n indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can\\n affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we\\n realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities be\\ning used as a source of income.As\\n of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover\\n period.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we\\n had  recorded  aggregate  liabilities  of  $1.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.3  billion  and  $1.3  billion  relate  to  non-income  tax  matters,respectively,\\n in  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  all  of  our  legal,  regulatory  and  non-income  tax  matters  that  wereprobable and reasonably est\\nimable.We\\n are  currently  party  to  various  legal  and  regulatory  matters  that  have  arisen  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  include,  among  others,  allegedindependent\\n contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims,unfair\\n competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act(“TCPA”)\\n claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, andother\\n matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit\\n proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia\\n State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification\\n claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange\\n of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results ofoperations,\\n or cash flows.

If one or more of these matterswere\\n resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of  management's  expectations,  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be  materiallyadversely affected.\\nDriver Classification\\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\\nIn\\n January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the“ABC”\\n test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming\\n services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity’s\\n control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed fo\\nr the hiring entity.On\\n May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan\\n Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive\\n advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On\\n August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the\\n Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed apetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Co\\nurt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November2020, and requested that the Court o\\nf Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.Proposition\\n 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result ofthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers \\nare able to maintain their status as independent contractors127\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16,2020.\\nThe\\n California  Supreme  Court  declined  the  petition  for  review  on  February  10,  2021.  The  lawsuit  was  returned  to  the  trial  court  following  the  appellateproceedings on February 22, 20\\n21. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction withthe\\n trial  court.  On April 16, 2021, the trial  court  signed an order  granting the stipulation.  Although the preliminary  injunction  has been dissolved, the lawsuitremains\\n ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, theAlameda\\n County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision withthe California Court of Appeal, \\nand the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization has also filed an appeal.Massachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney Gene\\nral filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Driversare\\n employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss thecomplaint\\n on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion inwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motio\\nn to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022. Our chances of success onthe merits are sti\\nll uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.Swiss Social Security Reclassi\\nficationSeveral\\n Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or ofUber\\n B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, aruling\\n was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V.\\n are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 asdependent\\n workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno\\n impact on our current operations. The ultimate resolution of the social security matters for the other two entities is uncertain and the amount accrued for thismatter is recorded within accr\\nued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\\nOn\\n October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting thatthey\\n should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. Thetribunal ruled\\n on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment ofthe\\n App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in Ju\\nly 2020.On\\n February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay \\nincluding holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.On\\n March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber.\\n They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed asettlement\\n process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register fora\\n settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  have  extended  offers  to  all  drivers  eligible  forsettlement\\n who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.

The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,against\\n both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interestsowed\\n from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principalrevised\\n amount of the assessment and are engaged in ongoing discussions with the NJDOL about the assessments. While the ultimate resolution of this matter isuncertain, we recorded fo\\nr this matter within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Google v. Levandowski & Ron; Google v. Levandowski\\nOn\\n October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir\\n respective  employment  agreements  with  Google,  fraud  and  other  state  law  violations  (due  to  soliciting  Google  employees  and  starting  a  new  venture  tocompete with Google’s business in contraventio\\nn of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the\\n arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google’s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony\\n Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest\\n for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel’s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle\\n entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon\\n behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber’s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether\\n Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In\\n March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levando\\nwski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking\\n, LLC. For these claims, Uber and Levandowski reached a confidential settlement in principle that isscheduled\\n for an approval hearing with the court on March 3, 2022. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, we have recorded for this matterwithin accrued and other cu\\nrrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.Non-Income Tax Matters\\nWe recorded an estimated liability\\n for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities withregard\\n to such matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax\\n treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe\\n applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as  well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  onpayments made to such Drivers.\\nWe\\n are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Beingclassified\\n as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively.\\n HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider\\n the U.K. Supreme Court’s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers’ worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation\\n services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting\\n HMRC’s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (“pay-to-play\\n”) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings.Our\\n estimated  liability  is  inherently  subjective  due  to  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  the  judicial  processes  in  certain  jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome c\\nould be different from the estimated liability recorded.129\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors foran aggregate considera\\ntion of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, thePreferred\\n Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. As of December 31, 2020, we retained the remaining85.8% ownership interest. SoftBank and Toyot\\na are our existing investors. At\\n the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units are convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potentialadjustment,\\n as  defined  by  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  at  any  time.  The  Preferred  Units  are  entitled  to  certain  distributions,  including  primarilydividends\\n which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate's discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.The Preferred Units are en\\ntitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) theoriginal investment\\n plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately priorto\\n the  sale  or  liquidation  event.  The  quarterly  dividend,  along  with  any  attributed  prorated  share  of  Apparate’s  net  income  (if  applicable),  are  included  in  netincome\\n (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations.

Beginning on July 2, 2026, we can call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held bySoftBank\\n at the Put/Call Price. We have the option to settle all, or a portion of, the Put/Call Price with its common stock and any remainder will be satisfied incash.\\n The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they are not separately exercisable or legally detachedfrom the SoftBank Preferred Uni\\nts.As\\n of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests in our consolidated financial statements andreported\\n at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date. The initial fair value of SoftBank’s Preferred Units was determined based on ahybrid\\n method with the option pricing model as the primary methodology. This method used Level 3 fair value measurement inputs as well as an assumed equalprobability\\n of the occurrence of a liquidation or exit event. The significant unobservable inputs used in the initial fair value measurement include: volatility of42%,\\n time to liquidity of 5 years, and a discount for lack of marketability of 17%. A market approach was also used to corroborate the valuation derived from thehybrid\\n method  at  issuance  to  evidence  that  the  issuance  price  of  the  Preferred  Units  approximated  their  fair  value.  There  was  no  fair  value  adjustment  toSoftBank’s redeemable non-con\\ntrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2020.Toyota and DENSO’s Preferred Units\\nAs of\\n December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units  were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subjectto any mandatory redempt\\nion rights or redemption rights that are outside our control. ATG Collaboration Agreement with Apparate, Toyota and DENSO\\nIn\\n conjunction  with  the  Preferred  Unit  Purchase  Agreement  discussed  above,  we  entered  into  a  three-year  joint  collaboration  agreement  among  Toyota,DENSO,\\n and Apparate to develop next-generation self-driving technology (the “ATG Collaboration Agreement”), which became effective as of the closing of thePreferred\\n Unit  Purchase  Agreement  in  July  2019.  Pursuant  to  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement,  Toyota  would  make  cash  payments  to  Apparate  up  to  anaggregate\\n of $300 million, payable in six semi-annual installments during the three-year term of the ATG Collaboration Agreement. The cash payments for eachsix-month\\n period were contingent upon the mutual agreement between the parties on the development activities and milestones to be achieved in the next sixmonths\\n and  the  continuation  of  the  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement.  The  ATG  Collaboration  Agreement  was  within  the  scope  of  ASC  808,  CollaborativeArrangements.\\n The development activities were considered ongoing and central to the activities of ATG.

Cornershop\\nOn\\n July  6,  2020,  we  closed  the  acquisition  of  a  55%  controlling  ownership  interest  in  CS-Global.  Refer  to  Note  18  –  Business  Combinations  for  furtherinformation.\\n As of December 31, 2020, the non-controlling interest in CS-Global was classified as redeemable non-controlling interest because it is subject to aput/call\\n agreement  which was  not solely  in our  control  to  exercise.  At  each  balance  sheet  date,  the redeemable  non-controlling  interest  was measured  using adiscounted\\n cash  flow  methodology  and  the  carrying  value  was  adjusted  if  the  fair  value  was  higher  than  the  carrying  value.  The  initial  fair  value,  as  of  theacquisition date\\n of July 6, 2020, was $290 million. There were no fair value adjustments to CS-Global’s redeemable non-controlling interest during the year endedDecember\\n 31,  2020.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  Cornershop’s  financial  results  were  consolidated  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  given  our  majorityownership interest.\\nOn\\n January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, which increased the redeemablenon-controlling interest. In August 20\\n21, we acquired the minority shareholders' interests in CS-Global in an all-stock transaction and CS-Global became a wholly-owned\\n subsidiary of ours. We derecognized the carrying value of redeemable non-controlling interests in CS-Global of $1.3 billion.

During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the “Initial CornershopInvestment”). The rem\\naining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During\\n the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin\\n order for Uber to acquire Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructuredsuch\\n that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as “CS-Mexico”), while allof the remaining Cornershop ope\\nrations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.On July\\n 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico.This\\n transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global\\n and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial CornershopInvestment\\n was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber’s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage,\\n the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal\\n $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe\\n outstanding  membership  interests.  As  a  result,  we  obtained  the  controlling  financial  interest  in  CS-Global  and  accounted  for  the  acquisition  as  a  businesscombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition\\n transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controllinginterest\\n in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of theinterests\\n in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (“CS-Mexico Put/Call”). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-Global)\\n or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capitalcontribution\\n to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico.

CONTROLS AND\\n PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe\\n maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile\\n or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods\\n specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our\\n Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)\\n under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure\\n controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer\\n and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reas\\nonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes to\\n our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely t\\no materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur\\n management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial repor\\nting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement\\n does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system,\\n no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives\\n will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, \\nif any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur\\n management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange\\n Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in“Internal\\n Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on thatassessment,\\n our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers\\n LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021. You can find the fu\\nll text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In\\n accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting\\n for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal\\n control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (“Drizly”), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”), which we acquired inNovember\\n 2021, as discussed in Note 18 – Business Combinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results ofthese\\n in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related toDrizly\\n and Transplace that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented approximately 3% and 4% ofour consolidated total ass\\nets and total revenues as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.ITEM 9B.
